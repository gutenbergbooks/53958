<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>On September 15, 1906, the Training School for
Backward and Feeble-minded Children at Vineland,
New Jersey, opened a laboratory and a Department
of Research for the study of feeble-mindedness.</p>

<p>A beginning was made in studying the mental condition
of the children who lived in the Institution, with
a view to determining the mental and physical peculiarities
of the different grades and types, to getting an
accurate record of what deficiencies each child had
and what he was capable of doing, with the hope that
in time these records could be correlated with the condition
of the nervous system of the child, if he should
die while in the Institution and an autopsy should be
allowed.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after the beginning of this work,
a definite start was made toward determining the cause
of feeble-mindedness. After some preliminary work,
it was concluded that the only way to get the information
needed was by sending trained workers to the
homes of the children, to learn by careful and wise
questioning the facts that could be obtained. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
a great surprise to us to discover so much mental defect
in the families of so many of these children. The results
of the study of more than 300 families will soon be
published, showing that about 65 per cent of these
children have the hereditary taint.</p>

<p>The present study of the Kallikak family is a genuine
story of real people. The name is, of course, fictitious,
as are all of the names throughout the story. The
results here presented come after two years of constant
work, investigating the conditions of this family.</p>

<p>Some readers may question how it has been possible
to get such definite data in regard to people who lived
so long ago.</p>

<p>A word of explanation is hence in order. In the first
place, the family itself proved to be a notorious one, so
the people, in the community where the present generations
are living, know of them; they knew their parents
and grandparents; and the older members knew them
farther back, because of the reputation they had always
borne. Secondly, the reputation which the Training
School has in the State is such that all have been willing
to coöperate as soon as they understood the purpose and
plan of the work. This has been of great help. Thirdly,
the time devoted to this investigation must not be overlooked.
A hasty investigation could never have produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the results which we have reached. Oftentimes
a second, a third, a fifth, or a sixth visit has been necessary
in order to develop an acquaintance and relationship
with these families which induced them gradually
to relate things which they otherwise had not recalled
or did not care to tell. Many an important item has
been gathered after several visits to these homes. <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter
IV</a> will throw still more light on the method used.</p>

<p>If the reader is inclined to the view that we must
have called a great many people feeble-minded who
were not so, let him be assured that this is not the case.
On the contrary, we have preferred to err on the other
side, and we have not marked people feeble-minded
unless the case was such that we could substantiate it
beyond a reasonable doubt. If there was good reason
to call them normal, we have so marked them. If not,
and we are unable to decide in our own minds, we have
generally left them unmarked. In a few cases, we have
marked them normal or feeble-minded, with a question
mark. By this is meant that we have studied the case
and after deliberation are still in doubt, but the probabilities
are “N” or “F” as indicated. The mere
fact of the doubt shows, however, that they are at
least border-line cases.</p>

<p>To the scientific reader we would say that the data<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
here presented are, we believe, accurate to a high degree.
It is true that we have made rather dogmatic
statements and have drawn conclusions that do not
seem scientifically warranted from the data. We have
done this because it seems necessary to make these
statements and conclusions for the benefit of the lay
reader, and it was impossible to present in this book
all of the data that would substantiate them. We have,
as a matter of fact, drawn upon the material which is
soon to be presented in a larger book. The reference
to Mendelism is an illustration of what we mean. It
is, as it is given here, meager and inadequate, and the
assumption that the given law applies to human heredity
is an assumption so far as the data presented are
concerned. We would ask that the scientist reserve
judgment and wait for the larger book for the proof of
these statements and for an adequate discussion of
Mendelism in relation to the problem.</p>

<p>The necessary expense for this study, as well as for all
of the work of the Research Laboratory, has been met
by voluntary contributions from philanthropic men and
women, who believe that here is an opportunity to
benefit humanity, such as is hardly equaled elsewhere.</p>

<p>We take this means of expressing to them our deep
appreciation of their sympathy and generosity. I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
also to make special mention of the indefatigable industry,
wisdom, tact, and judgment of our field workers
who have gathered these facts and whose results, although
continually checked up, have stood every test
put upon them as to their accuracy and value.</p>

<p>The work on this particular family has been done by
Elizabeth S. Kite, to whom I am also indebted for practically
all of <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>.</p>

<p>I am also greatly indebted to my assistants in the
laboratory, for help in preparing the charts, keeping
the records, and correcting manuscript and proof.</p>

<p>To Superintendent Edward R. Johnstone, whose
wisdom and foresight led to the establishment of this
Department of Research, whose help, sympathy, and
encouragement have been constant throughout the
work of preparing this study, the thanks and gratitude
of the entire group of readers who find in these
facts any help toward the solution of the problems
that they are facing, are due.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STORY OF DEBORAH</span></h2>

<p>One bright October day, fourteen years ago, there
came to the Training School at Vineland, a little eight-year-old
girl. She had been born in an almshouse. Her
mother had afterwards married, not the father of this
child, but the prospective father of another child, and
later had divorced him and married another man, who
was also the father of some of her children. She had
been led to do this through the efforts of well-meaning
people who felt that it was a great misfortune for a child
to be born into the world illegitimately. From their
standpoint the argument was good, because the mother
with four or five younger children was unable to provide
adequately for this little girl, whom both husbands refused
to support.</p>

<p>On the plea that the child did not get along well at
school and might possibly be feeble-minded, she gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
admission to the Training School, there to begin a career
which has been interesting and valuable to the Institution,
and which has led to an investigation that cannot
fail to prove of great social import.</p>

<p>The following are extracts from her history since she
came to the Institution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

plays by ear. She has not learned to read the notes
of these two scales, simply because she will not put
her mind to it. She has played hymns in simple time,
but the fingering has had to be written for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. ’01.</i>&mdash;Has nearly finished outlining a pillow
sham. Can do very good work when she tries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">English.</span> Does better in number work than in any
other branch. Her mind wanders a great deal. In
the midst of a lesson, that she has apparently paid a
great deal of attention to, she will ask a question that
has no bearing on the lesson at all. Is slow to learn.</p>

<p><i>Nov. ’01.</i>&mdash;Is very good in number work, especially
in addition. Can add 25 and 15. Spells a few
words, such as “wind,” “blows,” “flowers.” Writes
fairly well from copy if she tries. Her attention is
very hard to keep. Is restless in class. Likes to
be first in everything. The one thing she does best
in school is to add numbers with pegs. Knows about
fifteen words, such as “cat,” “fan,” “run,” “man.” She
could learn more in school if she would pay attention,
but her mind seems away off from the subject in discussion.
Could play scale of C and F on cornet and
would play some by ear if she could have kept up her
lessons. Was taken out on account of sore throat.</p>

<p><i>Nov. ’04.</i>&mdash;Understands how to make bead
chains. Has made four. Knows how to use a sewing
machine. Has made a shirtwaist. Uses tape
measure accurately. Can play on cornet four
hard band pieces and three solos, also reads at sight
easy songs and hymns. Band pieces are: “Attention,
March!” “Quick Step Sterling,” “Onward, Christian
Soldiers,” and “Star-spangled Banner.” Solos are:
“America,” “Old Black Joe,” and “Onward, Christian
Soldiers.” Conduct at school, fair.</p>

<p><i>Jan. ’07.</i>&mdash;Took the part of Mrs. Doe in “Fun
in a Photograph Gallery.”</p>

<p><i>Feb. ’08.</i>&mdash;Can write a fairly good story, but spells
very few words. Has little idea of the use of capitals.
It is difficult for her to separate her sentences. Drawing,
painting, coloring, and any kind of hand work
she does quite nicely. In clay modeling, her idea of
form is quite good. Is much improved in conduct.
Does not act so wild in class.</p>

<p>In wood-carving class, she starts a thing she wants to
do very enthusiastically, but if it takes her very long,
her interest flags and she has to be spurred on by the
thought of the result when well done. This year
she has made a carved book rest with mission ends
and is now working on a shirtwaist box with mortise
and tenon joints and lap joints. The top will be
paneled. She can do most of her own marking
when shown how.</p>

<p>Has made a great improvement in “Band” during
the last year. Can get a better tone on the cornet
and more volume. Reads by note all music that she
plays. Plays second cornet parts to about twenty-five
pieces.</p>

<p><i>Jan. ’09.</i>&mdash;Has embroidered the front of a shirtwaist
and the front gore of a skirt. She has shown
a great amount of patience, perseverance, and judgment
in her work this year, has been anxious to do
her work, and has been a good girl. In wood carving
she is doing much more careful work than last year.</p>

<p>Has made a large “Skolcroft” chair with only a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
help in putting it into clamps. Did her own measuring
and carved the wood. She filled the wood herself
before staining. This she had never done before.</p>

<p><i>June, ’09.</i>&mdash;Made the suit which she had embroidered
earlier in the year, using the machine in
making it. Helped F. B. put her chair together and
really acted as a teacher in showing her how to upholster
it. Will be a helper in wood-carving class
this summer.</p>

<p>Took important part in the Christmas play of 1908
and was a “Fan Girl” in the Japanese play given
Annual Day, 1909.</p>

<p><i>Mar. ’11.</i>&mdash;Works just about the same in wood-carving
class as she has other years. Can work very
rapidly when she tries, but does not very often try.
Does not have much confidence in herself when marking
out her work, but when urged, keeps trying until
she gets it right. Is making a large dressing case
this year. Is doing very nice work, especially in
physical culture class.</p>

<p><i>May, ’11.</i>&mdash;Finished her dressing case, but was
careless towards the last, so it is not quite as nice as
was expected. Made a very handsome embroidered
linen dress (satin stitch and eyelets), also an embroidered
corset cover. Made up both pieces under
direction. Can write a well-worded story, but has to
have more than half the words spelled for her.
Knows very few of her number combinations. Retains
a great many interesting facts connected with
nature work.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The reader will see that Deborah’s teachers have
worked with her faithfully and carefully, hoping for
progress, even seeing it where at a later date it became
evident that no real advance had been made. Note the
oft-repeated “She could if she would,” or “If she would
only pay attention,” and similar expressions, which
show the unwillingness of the teachers to admit even
to themselves that she is really feeble-minded. In the
earlier records it was noted that Deborah was not fond
of music, while in later reports it is shown to be her one
great accomplishment. To-day she is a woman of
twenty-two. The consensus of opinion of those who
have known her for the last fourteen years in the Institution
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“She is cheerful, inclined to be quarrelsome, very
active and restless, very affectionate, willing, and
tries; is quick and excitable, fairly good-tempered.
Learns a new occupation quickly, but requires a half
hour or twenty-four repetitions to learn four lines.
Retains well what she has once learned. Needs
close supervision. Is bold towards strangers, kind
towards animals. Can run an electric sewing machine,
cook, and do practically everything about the
house. Has no noticeable defect. She is quick and
observing, has a good memory, writes fairly, does
excellent work in wood-carving and kindergarten, is
excellent in imitation. Is a poor reader and poor at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
numbers. Does fine basketry and gardening. Spelling
is poor; music is excellent; sewing excellent;
excellent in entertainment work. Very fond of
children and good in helping care for them. Has a
good sense of order and cleanliness. Is sometimes
very stubborn and obstinate. Is not always truthful
and has been known to steal, although does not
have a reputation for this. Is proud of her clothes.
Likes pretty dresses and likes to help in other cottages,
even to temporarily taking charge of a group.”</p>

</div>

<p>The children at the Training School write letters to
Santa Claus asking for such things as they want for
Christmas. Here are Deborah’s requests each year,
beginning with ’99, when she was ten years old:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“’99.&mdash;Book and harmonica.</p>

<p>’03.&mdash;Post cards, colored ribbons, gloves and
shears.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in her history, number
was mentioned as being one of her strong points. Indeed,
she had a great deal of thorough drill in this
branch. In a recent testing to determine how much
of this she still retained, or whether the work had been
of any value as mental discipline, the results were negative.
It was discovered that she could neither add
nor subtract, except where it was a question of concrete
objects connected with her daily life. For example,
she can set a table and wait on it very nicely.
She can put the right number of plates at the head of
the table, if she knows the people who are to sit there,
but at a table with precisely the same number of strangers,
she fails in making the correct count.</p>

<p>At a recent test made before a prominent scientist,
the question was asked, “How many are 12 less 3?”
She thought for a moment, looked around the room and
finally answered, “Nine.” “Correct,” said her questioner.
“Do you know how I did it?” she asked,
delighted at her success. “I counted on my fingers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the questions asked her and her answers are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Q.</i> There are ten people to eat dinner. Seven
have eaten. For how many must you keep dinner
warm?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Three.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Suppose you had eight ergographs and sell
six. How many would be left?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> (after twenty-eight seconds’ pondering). Two.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Suppose you had eight Deltas and gave two
away. What would you have left?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Five.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Suppose there are eight at the table and two
leave. How many would remain?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> (after thirteen seconds). Six.</p>

</div>

<p>By the Binet Scale this girl showed, in April, 1910,
the mentality of a nine-year-old child with two points
over; January, 1911, 9 years, 1 point; September, 1911,
9 years, 2 points; October, 1911, 9 years, 3 points.
She answers correctly all of the questions up to age 7
except the repetition of five figures, where she transposes
two of them. She does not read the selection in the
required time, nor does she remember what she reads.
In counting the stamps, her first answer was “ten cents,”
which she later corrected. Under age 9, none of her
definitions are “<em>better than by use</em>”&mdash;“Fork is to eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
with,” “Chair to sit on,” etc. She can sometimes arrange
the weights in their proper order and at other
times not. The same is true of putting the three words
into a sentence. She does not know money. Her
definitions of abstract terms are very poor, in some
cases barely passable, nor can she put together the dissected
sentences. She rhymes “storm” with “spring,”
and “milk” with “mill,” afterwards using “bill,”
“will,” “till.”</p>

<p>In the revised questions, she does not draw the design
which is Question 2 in age 10, nor does she resist suggestion,
Question 4 in age 12. To the first part of
Question 5, age 12, she answered, “A bird hanging from
the limb,” and to the second part, “Some one was very
sick.”</p>

<p>This is a typical illustration of the mentality of a high-grade
feeble-minded person, the moron, the delinquent,
the kind of girl or woman that fills our reformatories.
They are wayward, they get into all sorts of trouble
and difficulties, sexually and otherwise, and yet we
have been accustomed to account for their defects on
the basis of viciousness, environment, or ignorance.</p>

<p>It is also the history of the same type of girl in the
public school. Rather good-looking, bright in appearance,
with many attractive ways, the teacher clings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the hope, indeed insists, that such a girl will come out
all right. Our work with Deborah convinces us that
such hopes are delusions.</p>

<p>Here is a child who has been most carefully guarded.
She has been persistently trained since she was eight
years old, and yet nothing has been accomplished in the
direction of higher intelligence or general education.
To-day if this young woman were to leave the Institution,
she would at once become a prey to the designs of
evil men or evil women and would lead a life that would
be vicious, immoral, and criminal, though because of her
mentality she herself would not be responsible. There
is nothing that she might not be led into, because she
has no power of control, and all her instincts and appetites
are in the direction that would lead to vice.</p>

<p>We may now repeat the ever insistent question, and
this time we indeed have good hope of answering it.
The question is, “How do we account for this kind of
individual?” The answer is in a word “Heredity,”&mdash;bad
stock. We must recognize that the human family
shows varying stocks or strains that are as marked and
that breed as true as anything in plant or animal life.</p>

<p>Formerly such a statement would have been a guess,
an hypothesis. We submit in the following pages
what seems to us conclusive evidence of its truth.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DATA</span></h2>

<p>The Vineland Training School has for two years
employed field workers. These are women highly
trained, of broad human experience, and interested in
social problems. As a result of weeks of residence at
the Training School, they become acquainted with the
condition of the feeble-minded. They study all the
grades, note their peculiarities, and acquaint themselves
with the methods of testing and recognizing
them. They then go out with an introduction from
the Superintendent to the homes of the children and
there ask that all the facts which are available may be
furnished, in order that we can know more about the
child and be better able to care for him and more wisely
train him.</p>

<p>Sometimes all necessary information is obtained from
the one central source, but more often, especially where
the parents are themselves defective, many visits to
other homes must be made. Parents often send the field
worker to visit near and distant relatives as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
neighbors, employers, teachers, physicians, ministers,
overseers of the poor, almshouse directors, etc.
These must be interviewed and all the information
thus obtained must be weighed and much of it verified
by repeated visits to the same locality before an
accurate chart of the particular child’s heredity can be
made.</p>

<p>In determining the mental condition of people in the
earlier generations (that is, as to whether they were
feeble-minded or not), one proceeds in the same way as
one does to determine the character of a Washington
or a Lincoln or any other man of the past. Recourse
is had to original documents whenever possible. In the
case of defectives, of course, there are not many original
documents. Oftentimes the absence of these, where
they are to be expected, is of itself significant. For
instance, the absence of a record of marriage is often
quite as significant as its presence. Some record or
memory is generally obtainable of how the person lived,
how he conducted himself, whether he was able to make
a living, how he brought up his children, what was his
reputation in the community; these facts are frequently
sufficient to enable one to determine, with a high degree
of accuracy, whether the individual was normal or
otherwise. Sometimes the condition is marked by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
presence of other factors. For example, if a man was
strongly alcoholic, it is almost impossible to determine
whether he was also feeble-minded, because the reports
usually declare that the only trouble with him was that
he was always drunk, and they say if he had been sober,
he would have been all right. This may be true, but
on the other hand, it is quite possible that he was feeble-minded
also.</p>

<p>After some experience, the field worker becomes expert
in inferring the condition of those persons who are
not seen, from the similarity of the language used in
describing them to that used in describing persons whom
she has seen.</p>

<p>In Deborah’s case, the woman first visited was the one
who interested herself in the child and its mother when
the latter had just given birth to her baby in the almshouse.
From this woman was learned the subsequent
history of Deborah’s mother as given in the first part of
this description. But references, supplied by her, soon
led to further discoveries. The present family was
found living within twenty miles of what was afterwards
learned to be its ancestral home and in a region that was
neither the slums of a city nor the wild desolation of the
extreme rural community, but rather in the midst of a
populous farming country, one of the best districts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the State. Thorough and carefully conducted investigations
in the small town and among the farmers
of this region showed that the family had always been
notorious for the number of defectives and delinquents
it had produced; and this notoriety made it possible
to trace them back for no less than six generations.</p>

<p>It was determined to make a survey of the entire
family and to discover the condition, as far as possible,
of every person in each generation.</p>

<p>The surprise and horror of it all was that no matter
where we traced them, whether in the prosperous rural
district, in the city slums to which some had drifted, or
in the more remote mountain regions, or whether it was
a question of the second or the sixth generation, an appalling
amount of defectiveness was everywhere found.</p>

<p>In the course of the work of tracing various members
of the family, our field worker occasionally found herself
in the midst of a good family of the same name,
which apparently was in no way related to the girl
whose ancestry we were investigating. In such cases,
there was nothing to be done but to beat a retreat and
start again in another direction. However, these cases
became so frequent that there gradually grew the conviction
that ours must be a degenerate offshoot from
an older family of better stock. Definite work was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
undertaken in order to locate the point at which the
separation took place. Over and over, the investigation
was laid aside in sheer despair of ever being able
to find absolute proofs or to establish missing links in
the testimony. Then some freshly discovered facts,
that came often quite unexpectedly, would throw new
light on the situation, and the work would be resumed.</p>

<p>The great-great-grandfather of Deborah was Martin
Kallikak.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That we knew. We had also traced the
good family, before alluded to, back to an ancestor belonging
to an older generation than this Martin Kallikak,
but bearing the same name. He was the father
of a large family. His eldest son was named Frederick,
but there was no son by the name of Martin. Consequently,
no connection could be made. Many months
later, a granddaughter of Martin revealed in a burst of
confidence the situation. She told us (and this was
afterwards fully verified) that Martin had a <em>half brother</em>
Frederick,&mdash;and that Martin never had an own brother
“because,” as she now naïvely expressed it, “you see,
his mother had him before she was married.” Deeper
scrutiny into the life of Martin Kallikak Sr., which was
made possible through well-preserved family records,
enabled us to complete the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>When Martin Sr., of the good family, was a boy of
fifteen, his father died, leaving him without parental
care or oversight. Just before attaining his majority,
the young man joined one of the numerous military
companies that were formed to protect the country at
the beginning of the Revolution. At one of the taverns
frequented by the militia he met a feeble-minded girl
by whom he became the father of a feeble-minded son.
This child was given, by its mother, the name of the
father in full, and thus has been handed down to posterity
the father’s name and the mother’s mental capacity.
This illegitimate boy was Martin Kallikak Jr.,
the great-great-grandfather of our Deborah, and from
him have come four hundred and eighty descendants.
One hundred and forty-three of these, we have conclusive
proof, were or are feeble-minded, while only forty-six
have been found normal. The rest are unknown or
doubtful.</p>

<p>Among these four hundred and eighty descendants,
thirty-six have been illegitimate.</p>

<p>There have been thirty-three sexually immoral persons,
mostly prostitutes.</p>

<p>There have been twenty-four confirmed alcoholics.</p>

<p>There have been three epileptics.</p>

<p>Eighty-two died in infancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Three were criminal.</p>

<p>Eight kept houses of ill fame.</p>

<p>These people have married into other families, generally
of about the same type, so that we now have on
record and charted eleven hundred and forty-six individuals.</p>

<p>Of this large group, we have discovered that two
hundred and sixty-two were feeble-minded, while one
hundred and ninety-seven are considered normal, the
remaining five hundred and eighty-one being still undetermined.
(“Undetermined,” as here employed,
often means not that we knew nothing about the person,
but that we could not decide. They are people we can
scarcely recognize as normal; frequently they are not
what we could call good members of society. But it
is very difficult to decide without more facts whether
the condition that we find or that we learn about, as in
the case of older generations, is or was really one of
true feeble-mindedness.)</p>

<p>In 1803, Martin Kallikak Jr., otherwise known as
the “Old Horror,” married Rhoda Zabeth, a normal
woman. (See <a href="#chart2">Chart II</a>.) They had ten children, of
whom one died in infancy and another died at birth
with the mother. Of those who lived, the oldest was
Millard, the direct ancestor of our Deborah. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
married Althea Haight, and they had fifteen children,
of whom more later.</p>

<p>The next born of Martin Jr. was Nathan, known in
the community as “Daddy” (see <a href="#chart3">Chart III</a>),<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who died
at the advanced age of ninety-three. He was the father
of six children. One of his sons was a criminal, a horse
thief, who also stole a flock of sheep which the owner all
unwittingly helped him to drive away. Three other
children of “Daddy” married and themselves had
children. These are all families about whose mentality
it is difficult to decide. They are all peculiar, but more
respectable than some other branches of this family.
One is dead. The sixth, a daughter, is feeble-minded
and sexually immoral. She married a man who was
feeble-minded and alcoholic. Of her six children, two
at least are feeble-minded. Whether her husband is
the father of all of the children is very doubtful. Sexual
immorality and alcoholism are prevalent in this
family. One of the sons married a feeble-minded
woman who came from feeble-minded stock. They
had six children, all of whom were feeble-minded. One
of these is of the Mongolian type, an interesting fact, as
it shows that this particular form of arrest of development
may occur in a defective family.</p>

<p>Martin Jr.’s third child was James (<a href="#chart2">Chart II</a>), who
went away, and we know nothing about him.</p>

<p>Martin Jr.’s fourth child, “Old Sal” (<a href="#chart4a">Chart IV</a>), was
feeble-minded and she married a feeble-minded man.
Two of their children are undetermined, but one of
these had at least one feeble-minded grandchild; the
other, an alcoholic man, had three feeble-minded grandchildren,
one of whom is in the Training School at Vineland.
She is thus a cousin of Deborah&mdash;a fact not
known until this study was made. The two other
children of Old Sal were feeble-minded, married feeble-minded
wives, and had large families of defective children
and grandchildren, as will be seen in the chart.</p>

<p>The fifth child of Martin Jr. was Jemima (<a href="#chart5a">Chart V</a>),
feeble-minded and sexually immoral. She lived with a
feeble-minded man named Horser, to whom she was
supposed to have been married. Of her five children,
three are known to have been feeble-minded, two are
undetermined. From these again, have come a large
number of feeble-minded children and grandchildren.
Jemima had an illegitimate son by a man who was high
in the Nation’s offices. This son married a feeble-minded
girl and they had feeble-minded children, and
grandchildren.</p>

<p>The sixth child of Martin Jr., known as “Old Moll”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
(<a href="#chart5b6">Chart VI</a>), was feeble-minded, alcoholic, epileptic, and
sexually immoral. She had three illegitimate children
who were sent to the almshouse, and from there bound
out to neighboring farmers. One of these turned out
normal, one was feeble-minded, and the other undetermined.
Neither of the two older ones had any children.
The third child, a daughter, was tubercular, but
nothing is known of her descendants, except that there
were several children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>The seventh child of Martin Jr. was a daughter,
Sylvia (<a href="#chart7">Chart VII</a>), who seemed to be a normal woman.
She was taken very young by a good family who brought
her up carefully. She later married a normal man.
Although we have marked her normal, she was always
peculiar. All her children and grandchildren were
either normal or are undetermined.</p>

<p>The youngest child of Martin Jr. who lived to grow
up was Amy Jones, also normal. (<a href="#chart8">Chart VIII</a>.) She,
too, was taken into a good family and married a normal
man, and lived to be very old. Two of Amy’s children
died in infancy. Of two others, one was normal and
one feeble-minded. This latter married a normal man
and had one feeble-minded and immoral daughter;
five other children are undetermined.</p>

<p>We now return to Martin Jr.’s oldest son, Millard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
(<a href="#chart9a">Chart IX</a>), to take up the story of his descendants, of
whom our girl Deborah is one.</p>

<p>Millard married Althea Haight about 1830. They
had fifteen children born in the following years: 1830,
1831, 1832, 1834, 1836, 1838, 1840, 1841, 1843, 1845,
1847, 1849, 1851, 1854, 1856. The mother died in 1857.
This mother, Althea Haight, was feeble-minded. That
she came from a feeble-minded family is evidenced by
the fact that she had at least one feeble-minded brother,
while of her mother it was said that the “devil himself
could not live with her.” The feeble-minded brother
had six children, of whom three are known to have been
feeble-minded. He had seven grandchildren who were
feeble-minded, and no less than nine feeble-minded great-grandchildren.
(These are not shown on the chart.)</p>

<p>The oldest child of Millard and Althea was a daughter
who grew up a feeble-minded and immoral woman.
She had several husbands, but only one of her children
lived to be old enough to marry. This one, a daughter
of illegitimate birth, married a man of good family who
was a confirmed alcoholic. Their children are all undetermined,
except one who was normal.</p>

<p>The second child of Millard, a daughter, was a bad
character. We know of one illegitimate and feeble-minded
son who married a feeble-minded and immoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
girl. They had four children, but all died in infancy.
This wife was also the mother of an illegitimate son, who
was feeble-minded and sexually immoral.</p>

<p>The third child of Millard was Justin (<a href="#chart9e">Chart IX, section
E</a>), the grandfather of our Deborah. His family
we shall discuss later.</p>

<p>According to Mendelian expectation, all of the children
of Millard Kallikak and Althea Haight should have
been feeble-minded, because the parents were such.
The facts, so far as known, confirm this expectation, with
the exception of the fourth child, a daughter, who was
taken into a good family and grew up apparently a
normal woman. She married a normal man and they
had one son who was normal. He married a normal
woman and they have two children, a boy and girl,
who are normal and above average intelligence.</p>

<p>The fifth child was Albert, feeble-minded, who died
at twenty-five, unmarried.</p>

<p>The sixth child was Warren, who had four children,
three of whom were feeble-minded and of very doubtful
morality. Each of the three had feeble-minded children.
One of these, Guss by name, was specially loose
and much mixed in his marital relations.</p>

<p>The seventh child was Lavinia, who died unmarried
at the age of thirty-nine. She had been brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in a good family and never manifested any of those
characteristics that indicate feeble-mindedness.</p>

<p>The eighth was Cordelia, who died at nine; condition
unknown.</p>

<p>The ninth was Prince, who died at four years.</p>

<p>The tenth was Paula, feeble-minded; married and
had four children. Her husband and children are undetermined.</p>

<p>Then comes Gregory, the eleventh, who was feeble-minded
and alcoholic. He married an alcoholic and
syphilitic woman, mentality difficult to determine.
They had seven children, of whom two were feeble-minded,
syphilitic, alcoholic, and sexually immoral.
One died of delirium tremens, the other of alcoholism,
leaving a long line of descendants. The other children
died young, except one daughter who has a feeble-minded
grandchild who cannot speak.</p>

<p>The twelfth child was Harriet, feeble-minded, twice
married, but without children.</p>

<p>The thirteenth, Sanders, who was drowned as a
young man, was feeble-minded and sexually immoral.</p>

<p>The fourteenth was Thomas, feeble-minded, alcoholic,
and sexually immoral. He died from over self-indulgence.
He was married and had a daughter, but her
condition as well as her mother’s is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The last child was Joseph, feeble-minded. He
married his first cousin, Eva Haight, who was also
feeble-minded. They had five children, two dying in
infancy, and the rest feeble-minded. Of their nineteen
grandchildren, five died in infancy, one is undetermined,
and the remaining thirteen are all feeble-minded.</p>

<p>Millard Kallikak married for his second wife a normal
woman, a sister of a man of prominence. She
was, however, of marked peculiarity. By her, he had
three children; two died in infancy. The one who
grew to manhood was alcoholic and syphilitic. He ran
off with the wife of his nephew, who was about his
own age. His mental condition is undetermined. He
was killed by an accident a few years later.</p>

<p>We now return to the third born of this family, Justin
Kallikak, the grandfather of our Deborah (<a href="#chart9e">Chart
IX, section E</a>). He was feeble-minded, alcoholic, and
sexually immoral. He married Eunice Barrah, who belonged
to a family of dull mentality. Her mother and
paternal grandfather were feeble-minded, and the grandfather
had a brother that was feeble-minded. That
brother had at least six descendants who were feeble-minded.
The father, also, had a brother feeble-minded
who had eleven children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren
who were feeble-minded. (Not shown).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The children of Deborah’s grandparents, Justin and
Eunice, were as follows: first, Martha, the mother of
our Deborah, whose story has already been partly told.
This woman is supposed to have had three illegitimate
children before Deborah was born. They died in infancy.
The next younger half sister of Deborah was
placed out by a charitable organization when very
young. From their records we learn that in five years
she had been tried in thirteen different families and by
all found impossible. In one of these she set the barn
on fire. When found by our field worker, she had
grown to be a girl of twenty, pretty, graceful, but of
low mentality. She had already followed the instinct
implanted in her by her mother, and was on the point
of giving birth to an illegitimate child. She was sent
to a hospital. The child died, and then the girl was
placed permanently in a home for feeble-minded. An
own brother of this girl was placed out in a private
family. When a little under sixteen, his foster mother
died and her husband married again. Thus the boy
was turned adrift. Having been well trained, and
being naturally of an agreeable disposition, he easily
found employment. Bad company, however, soon led
to his discharge. He has now drifted into one of our
big cities. It requires no prophet to predict his future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The last family of half brothers and sisters of Deborah
are, at present, living with the mother and her second
husband. The oldest three of these are distinctly
feeble-minded. Between them and the two younger
children there was a stillbirth and a miscarriage. The
little ones appear normal and test normal for their ages,
but there is good reason to believe that they will develop
the same defect as they grow older.</p>

<p>Besides the mother of Deborah, Justin and Eunice
had ten other children, of whom six died in infancy.
One of the daughters, Margaret, was taken by a good
family when a very small child. When she was about
thirteen, she visited her parents for a few weeks. While
her mother was away at work, her father, who was a
drunken brute, committed incest with her. When the
fact became known in her adopted home, she was placed
in the almshouse. The child born there soon died, and
she was again received into the family where she formerly
lived. The care with which she was surrounded
prevented her from becoming a vicious woman. Although
of dull mentality, she was a good and cheerful
worker. When about thirty-five, she married a respectable
workingman but has had no children by him.</p>

<p>Another daughter, Abigail, feeble-minded, married
a feeble-minded man by whom she had two feeble-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
children, besides a third that died in infancy.
She later married a normal man.</p>

<p>The next child of Justin and Eunice was Beede, who
is feeble-minded. He married a girl who left him before
their child was born. He lives at present with a
very low, immoral woman.</p>

<p>The youngest child of Justin and Eunice was a son,
Gaston, feeble-minded and a horse thief; he removed
to a distant town where he married. He has one child;
mentality of both mother and child undetermined.</p>

<p>This is the ghastly story of the descendants of Martin
Kallikak Sr., from the nameless feeble-minded girl.</p>

<p>Although Martin himself paid no further attention
to the girl nor her child, society has had to pay the
heavy price of all the evil he engendered.</p>

<p>Martin Sr., on leaving the Revolutionary Army,
straightened up and married a respectable girl of good
family, and through that union has come another line
of descendants of radically different character. These
now number four hundred and ninety-six in direct
descent. All of them are normal people. Three men
only have been found among them who were somewhat
degenerate, but they were not defective. Two of
these were alcoholic, and the other sexually loose.</p>

<p>All of the legitimate children of Martin Sr. married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
into the best families in their state, the descendants of
colonial governors, signers of the Declaration of Independence,
soldiers and even the founders of a great
university. Indeed, in this family and its collateral
branches, we find nothing but good representative citizenship.
There are doctors, lawyers, judges, educators,
traders, landholders, in short, respectable citizens,
men and women prominent in every phase of social
life. They have scattered over the United States and
are prominent in their communities wherever they
have gone. Half a dozen towns in New Jersey are
named from the families into which Martin’s descendants
have married. There have been no feeble-minded
among them; no illegitimate children; no immoral
women; only one man was sexually loose. There has
been no epilepsy, no criminals, no keepers of houses of
prostitution. Only fifteen children have died in infancy.
There has been one “insane,” a case of religious
mania, perhaps inherited, but not from the Kallikak
side. The appetite for strong drink has been present
here and there in this family from the beginning. It
was in Martin Sr., and was cultivated at a time when
such practices were common everywhere. But while
the other branch of the family has had twenty-four victims
of habitual drunkenness, this side scores only two.</p>

<p>The charts of these two families follow.</p>

<h3>THE CHARTS</h3>

<p><a href="#chart1">Chart I</a> shows the line of descent of the Kallikak
family from their first colonial ancestor. It was Martin
who divided it into a bad branch on one hand and
a good branch on the other. Each of these branches
is traced through the line of the eldest son down to a
person of the present generation. On the bad side
it ends with Deborah Kallikak, an inmate of the Training
School at Vineland, on the good side with the son
of a prominent and wealthy citizen of the same family
name, now resident of another State.</p>

<p><a href="#chart2">Chart II</a> shows the children of Martin Sr. by his wife
and by the nameless feeble-minded girl, and also the
children of Martin Jr.</p>

<p>Then follow Charts III to IX and A to K, giving in
detail each of these two branches, the upper series being
the normal family, the descendants of Martin Kallikak
Sr. through his wife: the lower is the bad family, his
descendants through the nameless feeble-minded girl
who was not his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h3>EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS</h3>

<p>Individuals are represented by squares and circles,
the squares being males, the circles, females. Black
squares and circles (with a white “F”) mean feeble-minded
individuals; N means normal persons.</p>

<p>The clear squares or circles indicate that the mentality
of the person is undetermined.</p>

<p>“d. inf.” means died in infancy.</p>

<p>A horizontal or slightly oblique line connects persons
who are mated. Unless otherwise indicated, they are
supposed to have been legally married.</p>

<p>The symbols dependent from the same horizontal
line are for brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>A vertical line connecting this horizontal line with
an individual or with a line connecting two individuals,
indicates the parent or parents of the fraternity.</p>

<p>Letters placed around the symbol for an individual
are as follows: A&mdash;Alcoholic, meaning decidedly intemperate,
a drunkard; B&mdash;Blind; C&mdash;Criminalistic;
D&mdash;Deaf; E&mdash;Epileptic; I&mdash;Insane; Sy&mdash;Syphilitic;
Sx&mdash;Sexually immoral; T&mdash;Tuberculous.</p>

<p>A short vertical line dependent from the horizontal
fraternity line indicates a child whose sex is unknown.
An F at the end of the line indicates that such child
was feeble-minded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>N? or F? indicates that the individual has not been
definitely determined, but, considering all the data, it
is concluded that on the whole, the person was probably
normal or feeble-minded, as the letter signifies.</p>

<p>A small d. followed by a numeral means died at
that age; b. means born, usually followed by the date.</p>

<p>A single figure below a symbol indicates that the symbol
stands for more than one individual&mdash;the number
denoted by the figure, <i>e.g.</i> a circle with a “4” below it,
indicates that there were four girls in that fraternity,
represented by that one symbol.</p>

<p>The Hand indicates the child that is in the Institution
at Vineland, whose family history is the subject of
the chart.</p>

<p>A black horizontal line under a symbol indicates that
that individual was in some public institution at state
expense.</p>

<p>The fact that the parents were not married is indicated
either by the expression “unmarried” or by the
word “illegitimate,” placed near the symbol for the
child.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT IT MEANS</span></h2>

<p>The foregoing charts and text tell a story as instructive
as it is amazing. We have here a family of good English
blood of the middle class, settling upon the original
land purchased from the proprietors of the state in
Colonial times, and throughout four generations maintaining
a reputation for honor and respectability of
which they are justly proud. Then a scion of this family,
in an unguarded moment, steps aside from the
paths of rectitude and with the help of a feeble-minded
girl, starts a line of mental defectives that is truly
appalling. After this mistake, he returns to the traditions
of his family, marries a woman of his own quality,
and through her carries on a line of respectability equal
to that of his ancestors.</p>

<p>We thus have two series from two different mothers
but the same father. These extend for six generations.
Both lines live out their lives in practically the same
region and in the same environment, except in so far as
they themselves, because of their different characters,
changed that environment. Indeed, so close are they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that in one case, a defective man on the bad side of the
family was found in the employ of a family on the
normal side and, although they are of the same name,
neither suspects any relationship.</p>

<p>We thus have a natural experiment of remarkable
value to the sociologist and the student of heredity.
That we are dealing with a problem of true heredity,
no one can doubt, for, although of the descendants of
Martin Kallikak Jr. many married into feeble-minded
families and thus brought in more bad blood, yet Martin
Jr. himself married a normal woman, thus demonstrating
that the defect is transmitted through the
father, at least in this generation. Moreover, the
Kallikak family traits appear continually even down
to the present generation, and there are many qualities
that are alike in both the good and the bad families,
thus showing the strength and persistence of the ancestral
stock.</p>

<p>The reader will recall the famous story of the Jukes
family published by Richard L. Dugdale in 1877, a
startling array of criminals, paupers, and diseased persons,
more or less related to each other and extending
over seven generations.</p>

<p>Dr. Winship has undertaken to compare this family
with the descendants of Jonathan Edwards, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
this comparison to draw certain conclusions. It is a
striking comparison, but unfortunately not as conclusive
as we need in these days. The two families
were utterly independent, of different ancestral stock,
reared in different communities, even in different States,
and under utterly different environment.</p>

<p>The one, starting from a strong, religious, and highly
educated ancestor, has maintained those traits and
traditions down to the present day and with remarkable
results; the other, starting without any of these advantages,
and under an entirely different environment,
has resulted in the opposite kind of descendants.</p>

<p>It is not possible to convince the euthenist (who
holds that environment is the sole factor) that, had the
children of Jonathan Edwards and the children of “Old
Max” changed places, the results would not have been
such as to show that it was a question of environment
and not of heredity. And he cites to us the fact that
many children of highly developed parents degenerate
and become paupers and criminals, while on the other
hand, some children born of lowly and even criminal
parents take the opposite course and become respectable
and useful citizens.</p>

<p>In as far as the children of “Old Max” were of
normal mentality, it is not possible to say what might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
not have become of them, had they had good training
and environment.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the cause of science, the Kallikak
family, in the persons of Martin Kallikak Jr. and his
descendants, are not open to this argument. They
were feeble-minded, and no amount of education or
good environment can change a feeble-minded individual
into a normal one, any more than it can change a red-haired
stock into a black-haired stock. The striking
fact of the enormous proportion of feeble-minded individuals
in the descendants of Martin Kallikak Jr.
and the total absence of such in the descendants of his
half brothers and sisters is conclusive on this point.
Clearly it was not environment that has made that
good family. They made their environment; and their
own good blood, with the good blood in the families
into which they married, told.</p>

<p>So far as the Jukes family is concerned, there is
nothing that proves the hereditary character of any of
the crime, pauperism, or prostitution that was found.
The most that one can say is that if such a family is
allowed to go on and develop in its own way unmolested,
it is pretty certain not to improve, but rather to propagate
its own kind and fill the world with degenerates
of one form or another. The formerly much discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
question of the hereditary character of crime received
no solution from the Jukes family, but in the light of
present-day knowledge of the sciences of criminology
and biology, there is every reason to conclude that
criminals are made and not born. The best material
out of which to make criminals, and perhaps the material
from which they are most frequently made, is
feeble-mindedness.</p>

<p>The reader must remember that the type of feeble-mindedness
of which we are speaking is the one to which
Deborah belongs, that is, to the high grade, or moron.
All the facts go to show that this type of people makes
up a large percentage of our criminals. We may argue
<i lang="la">a priori</i> that such would be the case. Here we have a
group who, when children in school, cannot learn the
things that are given them to learn, because through
their mental defect, they are incapable of mastering
abstractions. They never learn to read sufficiently
well to make reading pleasurable or of practical use to
them. The same is true of number work. Under our
compulsory school system and our present courses of
study, we compel these children to go to school, and
attempt to teach them the three R’s, and even higher
subjects. Thus they worry along through a few grades
until they are fourteen years old and then leave school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
not having learned anything of value or that can help
them to make even a meager living in the world. They
are then turned out inevitably dependent upon others.
A few have relatives who take care of them, see that
they learn to do something which perhaps will help in
their support, and then these relatives supplement
this with enough to insure them a living.</p>

<p>A great majority, however, having no such interested
or capable relatives, become at once a direct burden
upon society. These divide according to temperament
into two groups. Those who are phlegmatic, sluggish,
indolent, simply lie down and would starve to death, if
some one did not help them. When they come to the
attention of our charitable organizations, they are
picked up and sent to the almshouse, if they cannot be
made to work. The other type is of the nervous, excitable,
irritable kind who try to make a living, and not
being able to do it by a fair day’s work and honest
wages, attempt to succeed through dishonest methods.
“Fraud is the force of weak natures.” These become
the criminal type. The kind of criminality into which
they fall seems to depend largely upon their environment.
If they are associated with vicious but intelligent
people, they become the dupes for carrying out
any of the hazardous schemes that their more intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
associates plan for them. Because of their stupidity,
they are very apt to be caught quickly and sent to
the reformatory or prison. If they are girls, one of the
easiest things for them to fall into is a life of prostitution,
because they have natural instincts with no power
of control and no intelligence to understand the wiles
and schemes of the white slaver, the cadet, or the individual
seducer. All this, we say, is what is to be
expected. These are the people of good outward appearance,
but of low intelligence, who pass through
school without acquiring any efficiency, then go out into
the world and must inevitably fall into some such life
as we have pictured.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to our public institutions. These
have not yet been sufficiently investigated, nor have
we adequate statistics to show what percentage of their
inmates is actually feeble-minded. But even casual
observation of our almshouse population shows the
majority to be of decidedly low mentality, while careful
tests would undoubtedly increase this percentage
very materially.</p>

<p>In our insane hospitals may also be found a group
of people whom the physicians will tell you are only
partially demented. The fact is they properly belong
in an institution for feeble-minded, rather than in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for the insane, and have gotten into the latter because
an unenlightened public does not recognize the difference
between a person who has lost his mind and one who
never had one.</p>

<p>In regard to criminality, we now have enough studies
to make us certain that at least 25 per cent of this class
is feeble-minded. One hundred admissions to the Rahway
Reformatory, taken in order of admission, show
at least 26 per cent of them distinctly feeble-minded,
with the certainty that the percentage would be much
higher if we included the border-line cases.</p>

<p>An investigation of one hundred of the Juvenile
Court children in the Detention Home of the City of
Newark showed that 67 per cent of them were distinctly
feeble-minded. From this estimate are excluded children
who are yet too young for us to know definitely whether
the case is one of arrested development. This point
once determined would unquestionably swell the percentage
of defect.</p>

<p>An examination of fifty-six girls from a Massachusetts
reformatory, but out on probation, showed that fifty-two
of them were distinctly feeble-minded. This was
partially a selected group, the basis being their troublesomeness;
they were girls who could not be made to
stay in the homes that were found for them, nor to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
reasonable and sensible things in those homes, which
fact, of itself, pointed toward feeble-mindedness.</p>

<p>The foregoing are figures based on actual test examinations
as to mental capacity. If we accept the estimates
of the mental condition of the inmates made by the
superintendents of reformatories and penal institutions,
we get sometimes a vastly higher percentage; <i>e.g.</i> the
Superintendent of the Elmira Reformatory estimates
that at least 40 per cent of his inmates are mental
defectives.</p>

<p>Indeed, it would not be surprising if careful examination
of the inmates of these institutions should show
that even 50 per cent of them are distinctly feeble-minded.</p>

<p>In regard to prostitutes, we have no reliable figures.
The groups of delinquent girls to which we have already
referred included among the numbers several
that were already known as prostitutes. A simple
observation of persons who are leading this sort of life
will satisfy any one who is familiar with feeble-mindedness
that a large percentage of them actually are defective
mentally. So we have, as is claimed, partly
from statistical studies and partly from careful observation,
abundant evidence of the truth of our claim that
criminality is often made out of feeble-mindedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Winship in his comparison of the Jukes and Edwards
families has strengthened our claim in this respect.
In all environments and under all conditions,
he shows the latter family blossoming out into distinguished
citizens, not primarily through anything from
without but through the imperious force within. Since
we may conclude that none of the Edwards family,
who are described by Dr. Winship, were feeble-minded,
therefore none of them became criminals or prostitutes.
But here again his argument is inconclusive because he
does not tell us of all the descendants.</p>

<p>With equal safety it may be surmised that many of
the Jukes family (perhaps the original stock, indeed)
were feeble-minded and therefore easily lapsed into the
kind of lives that they are said to have lived.</p>

<p>In the good branch of the Kallikak family there were
no criminals. There were not many in the other side,
but there were some, and, had their environment been
different, no one who is familiar with feeble-minded
persons, their characteristics and tendencies, would
doubt that a large percentage of them might have become
criminal. Lombroso’s famous criminal types,
in so far as they were types, may have been types of
feeble-mindedness on which criminality was grafted
by the circumstances of their environment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Such facts as those revealed by the Kallikak family
drive us almost irresistibly to the conclusion that before
we can settle our problems of criminality and pauperism
and all the rest of the social problems that are
taxing our time and money, the first and fundamental
step should be to decide upon the mental capacity of
the persons who make up these groups. We must
separate, as sharply as possible, those persons who are
weak-minded, and therefore irresponsible, from intelligent
criminals. Both our method of treatment and our
attitude towards crime will be changed when we discover
what part of this delinquency is due to irresponsibility.</p>

<p>If the Jukes family were of normal intelligence, a
change of environment would have worked wonders
and would have saved society from the horrible blot.
But if they were feeble-minded, then no amount of
good environment could have made them anything
else than feeble-minded. Schools and colleges were
not for them, rather a segregation which would have
prevented them from falling into evil and from procreating
their kind, so avoiding the transmitting of their
defects and delinquencies to succeeding generations.</p>

<p>Thus where the Jukes-Edwards comparison is weak
and the argument inconclusive, the twofold Kallikak
family is strong and the argument convincing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Environment does indeed receive some support from
three cases in our chart. On <a href="#chart2">Chart II</a>, two children
of Martin Jr. and Rhoda were normal, while all the
rest were feeble-minded. It is true that here one parent
was normal, and we have the right to expect some normal
children. At the same time, these were the two
children that were adopted into good families and
brought up under good surroundings. They proved
to be normal and their descendants normal. Again,
on <a href="#chart9a">Chart IX-a</a>, we have one child of two feeble-minded
parents who proves to be normal&mdash;the only one
among the children. This child was also taken into a
good family and brought up carefully. Another sister
(<a href="#chart9b">Chart IX-b</a>) was also taken into a good family and,
while not determined, yet “showed none of the traits
that are usually indicative of feeble-mindedness.” It
may be claimed that environment is responsible for
this good result. It is certainly significant that the
only children in these families that were normal, or at
least better than the rest, were brought up in good
families.</p>

<p>However, it would seem to be rather dangerous to
base any very positive hope on environment in the
light of these charts, taken as a whole. There are too
many other possible explanations of the anomaly, <i>e.g.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
these cases may have been high-grade morons, who, to
the untrained person, would seem so nearly normal,
that at this late day it would be impossible to find
any one who would remember their traits well enough to
enable us to classify them as morons.</p>

<p>We must not forget that, on <a href="#chart9e">Chart IX-e</a>, we also have
the daughter of Justin taken into a good family and
carefully brought up, but in spite of all that, she proved
to be feeble-minded. The same is probably true of
Deborah’s half brother.</p>

<p>We have claimed that criminality resulting from
feeble-mindedness is mainly a matter of environment,
yet it must be acknowledged that there are wide differences
in temperament and that, while this one branch
of the Kallikak family was mentally defective, there
was no strong tendency in it towards that which our
laws recognize as criminality. In other families there
is, without doubt, a much greater tendency to crime, so
that the lack of criminals in this particular case, far
from detracting from our argument, really strengthens
it. It must be recognized that there is much more liability
of criminals resulting from mental defectiveness
in certain families than in others, probably because of
difference in the strength of some instincts.</p>

<p>This difference in temperament is perhaps nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
better brought out than in the grandparents of Deborah.
The grandfather belonging to the Kallikak family
had the temperament and characteristics of that family,
which, while they did not lead him into positive criminality
of high degree, nevertheless did make him a
bad man of a positive type, a drunkard, a sex pervert,
and all that goes to make up a bad character.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his wife and her family were
simply stupid, with none of the pronounced tendencies
to evil that were shown in the Kallikak family. They
were not vicious, nor given over to bad practices of any
sort. But they were inefficient, without power to get
on in the world, and they transmitted these qualities
to their descendants.</p>

<p>Thus, of the children of this pair, the grandparents of
Deborah, the sons have been active and positive in their
lives, the one being a horse thief, the other a sexual
pervert, having the alcoholic tendency of his father,
while the daughters are quieter and more passive.
Their dullness, however, does not amount to imbecility.
Deborah’s mother herself was of a high type of moron,
with a certain quality which carried with it an element
of refinement. Her sister was the passive victim of her
father’s incestuous practice and later married a normal
man. Another sister was twice married, the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
through the agency of the good woman who attended to
the legalizing of Deborah’s mother’s alliances, the last
time, the man, being normal, attended to this himself.
He was old and only wanted a housekeeper, and this
woman, having been strictly raised in an excellent
family, was famous as a cook, so this arrangement
seemed to him best. None of these sisters ever objected
to the marriage ceremony when the matter was
attended to for them, but they never seem to have
thought of it as necessary when living with any man.</p>

<p>The stupid helplessness of Deborah’s mother in regard
to her own impulses is shown by the facts of her
life. Her first child had for its father a farm hand; the
father of the second and third (twins) was a common
laborer on the railroad. Deborah’s father was a young
fellow, normal indeed, but loose in his morals, who,
along with others, kept company with the mother while
she was out at service. After Deborah’s birth in the
almshouse, the mother had been taken with her child
into a good family. Even in this guarded position,
she was sought out by a feeble-minded man of low
habits. Every possible means was employed to separate
the pair, but without effect. Her mistress then
insisted that they marry, and herself attended to all the
details. After Deborah’s mother had borne this man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
two children, the pair went to live on the farm of an
unmarried man possessing some property, but little
intelligence. The husband was an imbecile who had
never provided for his wife. She was still pretty, almost
girlish&mdash;the farmer was good-looking, and soon
the two were openly living together and the husband
had left. As the facts became known, there was considerable
protest in the neighborhood, but no active
steps were taken until two or three children had been
born. Finally, a number of leading citizens, headed
by the good woman before alluded to, took the matter
up in earnest. They found the husband and persuaded
him to allow them to get him a divorce. Then they
compelled the farmer to marry the woman. He agreed,
on condition that the children which were not his
should be sent away. It was at this juncture that
Deborah was brought to the Training School.</p>

<p>In visiting the mother in her present home and in
talking with her over different phases of her past life,
several things are evident; there has been no malice
in her life nor voluntary reaction against social order,
but simply a blind following of impulse which never
rose to objective consciousness. Her life has utterly
lacked coördination&mdash;there has been no reasoning
from cause to effect, no learning of any lesson. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
has never known shame; in a word, she has never
struggled and never suffered. Her husband is a
selfish, sullen, penurious person who gives his wife
but little money, so that she often resorts to selling soap
and other things among her neighbors to have something
to spend. At times she works hard in the field as a
farm hand, so that it cannot be wondered at that her
house is neglected and her children unkempt. Her
philosophy of life is the philosophy of the animal.
There is no complaining, no irritation at the inequalities
of fate. Sickness, pain, childbirth, death&mdash;she accepts
them all with the same equanimity as she accepts
the opportunity of putting a new dress and a gay ribbon
on herself and children and going to a Sunday School
picnic. There is no rising to the comprehension of the
possibilities which life offers or of directing circumstances
to a definite, higher end. She has a certain
fondness for her children, but is incapable of real solicitude
for them. She speaks of those who were placed
in homes and is glad to see their pictures, and has a
sense of their belonging to her, but it is faint, remote, and
in no way bound up with her life. She is utterly helpless
to protect her older daughters, now on the verge
of womanhood, from the dangers that beset them, or to
inculcate in them any ideas which would lead to self-control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
or to the directing of their lives in an orderly
manner.</p>

<p>The same lack is strikingly shown, if we turn our
attention to the question of alcoholism in this family.
We learn from a responsible member of the good branch
of the family that the appetite for alcoholic stimulants
has been strong in the past in this family and that several
members in recent generations have been more or
less addicted to its use. Only two have actually allowed
it to get the better of them to the extent that they
became incapacitated. Both were physicians. In the
other branch, however, with the weakened mentality,
we find twenty-four victims of this habit so pronounced
that they were public nuisances. We have taken no
account of the much larger number who were also addicted
to its use, but who did not become so bad as to
be considered alcoholic in our category.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the normal mentality of the good
branch of the family was able to cope successfully with
this intense thirst, while the weakened mentality on the
other side was unable to escape, and many fell victims
to this appalling habit.</p>

<p>It is such facts as these, taken as we find them, not
only in this family but in many of the other families
whose records we are soon to publish, that lead us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the conclusion that drunkenness is, to a certain extent
at least, the result of feeble-mindedness and that one
way to reduce drunkenness is first to determine the
mentally defective people, and save them from the
environment which would lead them into this abuse.</p>

<p>Again, eight of the descendants of the degenerate
Kallikak branch were keepers of houses of ill fame, and
that in spite of the fact that they mostly lived in a rural
community where such places do not flourish as they do
in large cities.</p>

<p>In short, whereas in the Jukes-Edwards comparison
we have no sound basis for argument, because the families
were utterly different and separate, in the Kallikak
family the conclusion seems thoroughly logical. We
have, as it were, a natural experiment with a normal
branch with which to compare our defective side. We
have the one ancestor giving us a line of normal people
that shows thoroughly good all the way down the generations,
with the exception of the one man who was
sexually loose and the two who gave way to the appetite
for strong drink.</p>

<p>This is our norm, our standard, our demonstration of
what the Kallikak blood is when kept pure, or mingled
with blood as good as its own.</p>

<p>Over against this we have the bad side, the blood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the same ancestor contaminated by that of the nameless
feeble-minded girl.</p>

<p>From this comparison the conclusion is inevitable
that all this degeneracy has come as the result of the
defective mentality and bad blood having been brought
into the normal family of good blood, first from the
nameless feeble-minded girl and later by additional
contaminations from other sources.</p>

<p>The biologist could hardly plan and carry out a more
rigid experiment or one from which the conclusions
would follow more inevitably.</p>

<span class="smaller">FURTHER FACTS ABOUT THE KALLIKAK FAMILY</span></h2>

<p>Although the foregoing facts, figures, and charts
show conclusively the difference between good heredity
and bad and the result of introducing mental deficiency
into the family blood, yet because it is so difficult actually
to appreciate the situation, because facts and figures
do not have flesh and blood reality in them, we give in
this chapter a few cases, graphically written up by
our field worker, to show the differences in the types
of people on the two sides of the family. These are
only a few of the many, but are fairly typical of the
condition of things that was found throughout the
investigation. On the bad side we have the type of
family which the social worker meets continually and
which makes most of our social problems. A study
of it will help to account for the conviction we have
that no amount of work in the slums or removing the
slums from our cities will ever be successful until we take
care of those who make the slums what they are. Unless
the two lines of work go on together, either one is
bound to be futile in itself. If all of the slum districts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of our cities were removed to-morrow and model tenements
built in their places, we would still have slums in
a week’s time, because we have these mentally defective
people who can never be taught to live otherwise
than as they have been living. Not until we take care
of this class and see to it that their lives are guided
by intelligent people, shall we remove these sores from
our social life.</p>

<p>There are Kallikak families all about us. They are
multiplying at twice the rate of the general population,
and not until we recognize this fact, and work on this
basis, will we begin to solve these social problems.</p>

<p>The following pictures from life have been prepared
by our field worker, Miss Elizabeth S. Kite, and besides
giving an idea of the family, they will also show something
of her method, and enable the reader to judge of
the reliability of the data.</p>

<p class="tb">On one of the coldest days in winter the field worker
visited the street in a city slum where three sons of
Joseph (<a href="#chart9d">Chart IX, section D</a>) live. She had previously
tested several of the children of these families in the
public school and found them, in amiability of character
and general mentality, strikingly like our own
Deborah, lacking, however, her vitality. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
no fire in their eyes, but a languid dreamy look, which
was partly due, no doubt, to unwholesome city environment.
In one house she found the family group&mdash;six
human beings, two cats, and two dogs&mdash;huddled in a
small back room around a cook stove, the only fire in
the house. In this room were accumulated all the
paraphernalia of living. A boy of eleven, who had
been tested in the school previously, was standing by
the fire with a swollen face. He had been kept home
on this account. In a rocking-chair, a little girl of
twelve was holding a pale-faced, emaciated baby. In
the corner two boys were openly exposing themselves.
The mother was making her toilet by the aid of a comb
and basin of water, set on the hearth of the stove; a pot
and kettle were on top. The entrance of the field
worker caused no commotion of any kind. The boy
with the swollen face looked up and smiled, the mother
smiled and went on with her toilet, the girl with the baby
smiled, the boys in the corner paid no attention. A
chair was finally cleared off and she sat down, while
everybody smiled. She learned that the husband made
a dollar a day and that the girl next older than the
child of twelve was married and had a baby. Another
younger girl was at school, the family having been at
last able to provide her with shoes. The girl of twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
should have been at school, according to the law, but
when one saw her face, one realized it made no difference.
She was pretty, with olive complexion and dark,
languid eyes, but there was no mind there. Stagnation
was the word written in large characters over
everything. Benumbed by this display of human
degeneracy, the field worker went out into the icy
street.</p>

<p class="tb">A short distance farther on, she came to the home
of another brother. The hideous picture that presented
itself as the door opened to her knock was one
never to be forgotten. In the first home, the type was
no lower than moron. One felt that when winter was
over and spring had come, the family would expand
into a certain expression of life&mdash;but here, no such
outlook was possible, for the woman at the head of this
house was an imbecile. In one arm she held a frightful
looking baby, while she had another by the hand.
Vermin were visible all over her. In the room were a
few chairs and a bed, the latter without any washable
covering and filthy beyond description. There was no
fire, and both mother and babies were thinly clad.
They did not shiver, however, nor seem to mind. The
oldest girl, a vulgar, repulsive creature of fifteen, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
into the room and stood looking at the stranger. She
had somehow managed to live. All the rest of the
children, except the two that the mother was carrying,
had died in infancy.</p>

<p class="tb">The following is a story of Guss, whose position will
be found on <a href="#chart9a">Chart IX, section A</a>.</p>

<p>When young, he married a normal girl who belonged
to a decent family, but had no education. After a few
months the mother of our Deborah came to visit them.
She was then a young girl, ready to associate with any
man who would look at her. The two behaved so
badly that the wife turned her out. This was the first
knowledge the wife had of the character of her husband.
She lived with him ten years or more. In that time
he did not average three months’ work out of twelve,
so she had, practically, to support him and her ever
increasing family. She knew that he was untrue to her,
but there was no way to prove it. At last she seemed
to grasp the situation. She began to believe that there
was something wrong with him mentally,&mdash;wrong with
the whole family,&mdash;so she decided to leave him. She
took her six living children, rented another house and
turned him adrift. He went at once to live with a
feeble-minded girl belonging to a low-grade family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the neighborhood. Soon after this girl’s child was born
he left her, becoming promiscuous in his relations. At
one time, he and two of his cousins spent the best part
of two days and nights in a tree to elude the police,
who were searching for them and another man, all of
whom had been accused by a girl then in confinement.
When the other man was caught and made to marry
the girl, they came down.</p>

<p>In 1904, this scion of the Kallikak family, Guss, went
off with a gypsy camp and was married to one of the
women. For some time he stayed with the camp, following
them into another State. In the neighborhood
where they located, a murder was committed which
was fastened upon the gypsies and finally settled upon
him. A great sensation was raised in the papers about
it. He was arrested, but finally cleared of the charge,
though not until he was effectually cured of his love for
gypsy life.</p>

<p>In 1907,&mdash;and here comes the most infamous part
of the story,&mdash;a minister married Guss to his own first
cousin, a woman of questionable character. The witnesses
were Guss’s sister and her husband. Every one
concerned, except the minister, knew that around the
corner, in a little street, so near that at certain hours
of the day the shadow of the church spire under which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
they were standing fell upon it, was a house in which
Guss’s lawful wife was living and working to support
his children. The minister, too, might have known,
had he taken the least trouble, and thus have been
spared the ignominy of uniting two such beings with
this travesty of the blessing of heaven. Soon after
their union, this couple ceased to live together&mdash;Guss
going off with another woman and his wife with another
man.</p>

<p>The field worker was not able to locate Guss, but she
found that a minister farther up the State had, in 1910,
married his late wife to the man with whom she was
living. The couple, however, had gotten wind that
some one was looking for them, so when the field
worker arrived, she found that they had moved on,
leaving no address.</p>

<p>The following story shows the continuation of these
conditions into the next generation:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was considered desirable to see the illegitimate son
of Guss, who had been born to the feeble-minded girl
after Guss had been turned adrift by his lawful wife.
This child had had, when young, a severe attack of
scarlet fever which deprived him of his hearing. He
had been admitted into a home for deaf children, but
the mother had taken him out. It was learned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
this girl had married her own cousin and that the pair
were living on the outskirts of a country town, with
this deaf boy and four of their own children.</p>

<p>Arrived at this place, the field worker first sought the
school where these children were supposed to go, hoping
to obtain some light on the question of their mentality
and also to learn their school record. She found that
they so seldom attended school that the teacher could
give very little information regarding them. By dint
of persistent inquiry, the family was discovered living
in the back shed of a dilapidated country tenement.</p>

<p>It was a bitter, cold day in February and about
eleven in the morning when the field worker knocked
at the door. Used as she was to sights of misery and
degradation, she was hardly prepared for the spectacle
within. The father, a strong, healthy, broad-shouldered
man, was sitting helplessly in a corner. The
mother, a pretty woman still, with remnants of ragged
garments drawn about her, sat in a chair, the picture
of despondency. Three children, scantily clad and
with shoes that would barely hold together, stood about
with drooping jaws and the unmistakable look of the
feeble-minded. Another child, neither more intelligent
nor better clad, was attempting to wash a few greasy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dishes in cold water. The deaf boy was nowhere to be
seen. On being urgently requested, the mother went
out of the room to get him, for he was not yet out of bed.
In a few moments she returned. The boy with her
wore an old suit that evidently was made to do service
by night as well as by day. A glance sufficed to establish
his mentality, which was low. The whole family
was a living demonstration of the futility of trying to
make desirable citizens from defective stock through
making and enforcing compulsory education laws.
Here were children who seldom went to school because
they seldom had shoes, but when they went, had neither
will nor power to learn anything out of books. The
father himself, though strong and vigorous, showed by his
face that he had only a child’s mentality. The mother
in her filth and rags was also a child. In this house
of abject poverty, only one sure prospect was ahead,
that it would produce more feeble-minded children
with which to clog the wheels of human progress. The
laws of the country will not permit children ten years
old to marry. Why should they permit it when the
mentality is only ten? These and similar questions
kept ringing through the field worker’s mind as she
made her way laboriously over the frozen road to the
station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the course of this investigation, it had been
learned that the father of Deborah’s mother had come,
when a young man, to the prosperous rural community
where his daughter was living at the time of our investigation.
The informant could not say whence he
had come, but the name of a person was given who was
supposed to know. Many fruitless attempts to find
this person were made before the object was attained.
When at last discovered, she turned out to be an elderly
lady of refinement and culture. Strangely enough,
long afterwards it was learned that she was connected
with the good side of the Kallikak family, but was all
unconscious of the relationship which existed between
it and the degenerate branch. She was delighted to
go back in memory and recall impressions made on her
mind in youth.</p>

<p>She had been raised in B&mdash;&mdash;, a town at the foot of a
mountain chain upon whose top the grandfather of
Deborah’s grandfather, Martin Kallikak Jr., had always
lived. When she was a little girl, he was a very old
man. She remembered being taken to drive, when a
child, and seeing the old hut on the mountain, where he
lived with his strange daughters, “Old Moll,” “Old
Sal,” and Jemima. The dilapidated dwelling, with its
windows bulging with rags, formed a picture she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
never forgotten. There were in her mind floating
memories of great scandals connected with these women
and their lonely mountain hut. The father went by
the name of the “Old Horror,” and as she remembered
him, he was always unwashed and drunk. At election
time, he never failed to appear in somebody’s cast-off
clothing, ready to vote, for the price of a drink, the
donor’s ticket.</p>

<p>This information, coming when it did, seemed amazing
and carried with it the probability of establishing
the certainty of defect transmitted through five generations.
But the town in question was remote and the
probability of finding any living person able to give
accurate information seemed so slight that nothing
further was done in this direction for many months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the families of the fifteen brothers
and sisters of Deborah’s grandfather had been worked
out, and the names of several living relatives back in
the mountain ascertained. The time was ripe.</p>

<p>Appealing for a night’s lodging at the home of a retired
farmer, the field worker was fortunate enough to
be received. As the hostess was showing her to a room,
she asked tentatively, “You have lived in B&mdash;&mdash; a
long time?” “About sixty-five years,” was the pleasant
reply. “So, then, you know something of most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the old families?” “There are not many old residents
of B&mdash;&mdash; with whose history I am not familiar.” Then
followed a few cautious questions in regard to the Kallikak
family which drew forth answers that soon convinced
the field worker she was on solid ground and
could advance without wasting time in needless precautions.
At this juncture, the supper bell rang. In
the dining room the acquaintance of the host was
made. When the meal was over, the couple turned
their united attention to the problem put before them.
“Why,” the host began, when he comprehended what
was wanted, “do you know that is the worst nest
you’re getting into, in the whole country? The mountains
back here are full of these people; I can point out
to you where every one of them lives.” Then he
turned to the table and began to sketch a map of the
mountain roads which must be followed next day. In
the midst of this he paused, as though an idea had come
to him, then he said hesitatingly, “You see, it’s
really impossible for a stranger like you to find all these
people. Some of them live on obscure back roads that
you could hardly get at without a guide. Now, my
time is of no value, and if you will permit me, I will
gladly serve in that capacity myself.” Needless to
say, his services were thankfully accepted, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
result that nearly two hundred persons were added to
Deborah’s family chart.</p>

<p>This proved, however, only the beginning of the
study that has been made of the family in the vicinity
of B&mdash;&mdash;. Numerous visits to many homes, always
from the center of the genial couple’s house, have made
the field worker such a well-known figure among these
people, that they long ago forgot what little surprise
they may have felt at her first visit. “You’re one of
the family?” was frequently asked her at the beginning.
“No, not really, only as I know so many of
your cousins and aunts and uncles, I thought, since I
was in B&mdash;&mdash;, I would like to know you.” This usually
sufficed, but if it did not, the field worker was able so to
inundate the questioner with information about his
own relatives, that before she was through, he had forgotten
that anything remained unanswered. The relation
once established, no further explanation was
necessary. She was able to go in and out among them,
study their mentality, awake their reminiscences, until
finally the whole story was told.</p>

<p>Besides members of the family, numerous old people
were here and there discovered who were able to add
materially to the information otherwise obtained.
One shrewd old farmer who was found tottering in from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the field proved to be of especial service in determining
the mental status of Martin Kallikak Jr. In introducing
herself, the field worker had spoken of her interest
in Revolutionary times and of having come to him because
she had been told that he was well informed as
to the history of the locality. “Yes,” he said, with
excusable pride, as he led the way to the kitchen steps
descending into the garden, “not much has happened
in this place for the last seventy years in which I have
not taken an active part. Do you see that tree there?”
and he pointed to a fine maple that threw its luxuriant
shade over the path that led to the barn. “The day my
wife and I came here sixty years ago, we planted that
tree. It was a little sapling then, and see what it has
become!” After much more talk she cautiously put
the question, “Do you remember an old man, Martin
Kallikak, who lived on the mountain edge yonder?”
“Do I?” he answered. “Well, I guess! Nobody’d
forget him. Simple,” he went on; “not quite right
here,” tapping his head, “but inoffensive and kind.
All the family was that. Old Moll, simple as she was,
would do anything for a neighbor. She finally died&mdash;burned
to death in the chimney corner. She had come
in drunk and sat down there. Whether she fell over
in a fit or her clothes caught fire, nobody knows. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was burned to a crisp when they found her. That was
the worst of them, they would drink. Poverty was
their best friend in this respect, or they would have
been drunk all the time. Old Martin could never stop
as long as he had a drop. Many’s the time he’s rolled
off of Billy Parson’s porch. Billy always had a barrel
of cider handy. He’d just chuckle to see old Martin
drink and drink until finally he’d lose his balance and
over he’d go! But Horser&mdash;he was a case! I saw
him once after I’d heard he was going to marry Jemima.
I looked him over and said, ‘Well, if you aren’t a fine-looking
specimen to think of marrying anybody!’
and he answered, ‘I guess you’re right&mdash;I aren’t much,
but I guess I’ll do fer Jemima.’</p>

<p>“Such scandals as there were when those girls were
young!” he continued. “You see, there was a fast
set of young men in B&mdash;&mdash; in those days, lawyers, who
didn’t care what they did. One of them got paid back,
though, for Jemima wanted to put her child on the
town, and they made her tell who was its father. Then
he had to give something for its support, and she gave it
this man’s full name. I saw him one day soon afterward
and he was boiling with rage. All the comfort
I gave him was to say, ‘I don’t see but what you’re
getting your just deserts, for if anybody wants to play
with the pot, they must expect to get blackened!’</p>

<p>“By the way! Do you know that old Martin had
a half brother Frederick&mdash;as fine a man as the country
owned&mdash;who lived about twenty miles from here?
You see, Martin’s mother was a young girl in Revolutionary
times when Martin’s father was a soldier.
Afterwards he went back home and married a respectable
woman.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see the mother of old Martin?” the
field worker asked. “No, she was dead before my time,
but I have heard the folks talk about her. She lived
in the woods not far from here. Dear me!” he went
on, “it’s been so long since I’ve thought of these people
that many things I forget, but it would all come back
to me in time.”</p>

<p>Two daughters of Jemima lived in B&mdash;&mdash;. A little
study of Chart V, sections <a href="#chart5a">A</a> and <a href="#chart5b6">B</a>, will place them in
their relation to the rest of the family and give the
chief facts of their lives. Little more need be added.
One of them was early put out to service and later
married a cobbler to whom she has borne many children.
She is not known to have had any illegitimate offspring,
but if she escaped, her daughter has made up for
her deficiency in this respect. The other sister grew
up in the mountain hut with her mother, and was living
there when her grandfather died. Her husband and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
most of her children are defective, but there are two by
unknown fathers who are normal. One of these, a
girl of considerable ability, supports herself and mother
in a decent way and is respected by her townspeople.
The mother is tall, lean, angular, much resembling
Jemima, except that the latter was even more masculine.
Many are the living inhabitants of B&mdash;&mdash; to whom
the old woman was a well-known figure, for she often
came down into the town bringing berries to sell, her
large feet shod with heavy boots, her skirts short, while
her sharp, angular features were hidden in the depths
of a huge sunbonnet. She thus formed a striking picture
that could not easily be forgotten.</p>

<p>A third daughter of Jemima had gone to Brooklyn to
live, and the question kept repeating itself, “What will
she be like?” and this all the more because of the uncertainty
of the parentage on the father’s side. Perhaps
he was a normal man. Perhaps this will prove to be
a normal woman and so break the dead monotony of
this line of defectives.</p>

<p>In a back tenement, after passing through a narrow
alley, the home of this woman was found. It was about
ten o’clock in the morning. After climbing a dark and
narrow stairway, one came to a landing from which
a view could be had of the interior of the apartment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
In one room was a frowsled young woman in tawdry
rags, her hair unkempt, her face streaked with black,
while on the floor two dirty, half-naked children were
rolling. At the sight of a stranger, they all came forward.
The field worker made her way as best she
could, across heaps of junk that cluttered the room,
to a chair by an open window through which a breath
of outside air could be obtained. On the bureau by
the window a hideous diseased cat was curled in the
sunshine. The mother, Jemima’s daughter, was not at
home, but the woman who had presented herself was
her daughter, and these were the grandchildren. The
woman’s feeble-mindedness made it possible to ask her
question after question, such as could not have been
put to a normal person. Her answers threw a flood of
light upon the general depravity of life under such
conditions. When the mother at last arrived, she
proved to be of a type somewhat different from anything
before encountered in this family. She appeared
to be criminalistic, or at least capable of developing
along that line. Unfortunately, the visit could not
either be prolonged or repeated, so that no satisfactory
study was made.</p>

<p>In the city, the individual is lost in the very immensity
of the crowd that surrounds him, so that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
individual actions, except such as he himself chooses to
reveal or can be made to reveal, are lost to the people
about him; therefore there was little hope of obtaining
much side light on the problem here presented. During
the short interview the older woman showed unmistakable
signs of wanting to appear respectable in the midst
of her depravity, something quite characteristic of the
high-grade moron type in the family. She was friendly
and distinctly more intelligent than her daughter, but
there was little more will power or ability to cope with
the problems of life. One of her daughters had disappeared
off the face of the earth a few years before&mdash;there
had been a baby&mdash;that was all they knew. She
was working at Coney Island. One day she came home
and, when she left the next morning, it was the last they
ever saw of her. A brother of the girl had also disappeared
in much the same way.</p>

<p>The field worker left the tenement with the positive
assurance that environment without strict personal
supervision made little difference when it was a question
of the feeble-minded.</p>

<p>Owing to the courtesy of the County Superintendent
and the intelligent coöperation of the teachers, it was
possible to apply the Binet tests to all the descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of Martin Kallikak who could be found in the schools.
The request for this had been made in a way to give
no clew to the particular purpose underlying the search.
By selecting from every class one or two bright pupils
to take the tests along with the dull ones, all personal
element was eliminated. As children everywhere are
found to delight in the tests, only those who were not
called out were disappointed.</p>

<p>A morning was spent in a schoolhouse situated on the
top of a bold, rocky ledge that went by the picturesque
name of Hard Scrabble. It was within a quarter of a
mile of the ruins of Martin Kallikak’s hut, and a number
of his descendants were enrolled among its pupils.</p>

<p>One of the grandsons of “Old Sal” lived on a farm
near Cedarhill, several miles farther up the ridge. This
man, Guss Saunders by name, had been reported to be
the father of a large family. Nothing, however, had
been learned of him beyond the facts stated, and therefore
the inference was that he had turned out better
than the rest of his brothers. It had been to determine
this matter that the long ride was undertaken.</p>

<p>Arrived at the farm, the question of the mentality of
this family was quickly answered. Desolation and
ruin became more apparent at every step. The front
of the large farmhouse was quite deserted, but following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a few tracks the back door was reached. Such an
unwonted spectacle as a visitor attracted instant attention.
The door opened, revealing a sight to which, alas,
the field worker was only too accustomed. She gazed
aghast at what appeared to her to be a procession of
imbeciles. The tall, emaciated, staggering man at the
head braced himself against a tree, while the rest stopped
and stood with a fixed, stupid stare. Quickly regaining
control, the field worker said pleasantly, “Good
afternoon, Mr. Saunders. I hope you don’t mind my
intruding on you this way, but you see I am looking up
the children of the neighborhood, and I was sorry not
to find any of yours in the Cedarhill school to-day.”
He at once thought he had to do with a school inspector,
and his answer bears no setting forth in print. It was
an incoherent, disjointed, explosive protest against
school laws in general and fate in particular. It was
mixed up with convulsive sobs, while his bleared, swollen
eyes brimmed over with tears. The field worker began
to feel real sympathy for the man, although she knew
that he was drunk and that drunkards are easily moved
to tears. “Oh, I am sorry for you,” she said; “your
wife then is dead, is she?” “Yes, she’s dead!” he
answered with a wild gesture, “they took her right
out of that room&mdash;they said they’d cure her, if I’d let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
her go. You can see the doctors in B&mdash;&mdash;, they know
all about it&mdash;they’ll tell you what they done&mdash;they
took her away, and she never come back&mdash;Oh!”
Stifling his sobs, he went on, “And now they say I
am to send my children to school&mdash;and what can I do?
Look there!” pointing to a lump of humanity, a girl
who, at first glance, had thrown her imbecilic shadow
over the whole group, making them all look imbecilic&mdash;“do
you see that girl? She’s always fallin’ into fits,
and nobody can’t do nothin’ with her.” Breaking in
here, the field worker said, “But, Mr. Saunders, you
ought not to have the burden and the care of that girl;
she could be made so happy and comfortable in a place
where they understand such cases. You ought&mdash;”
The field worker could get no farther. His eyes suddenly
assumed a wild, desperate look and he burst out,
“No, no! They’ll never get her. They tried it once,
but they didn’t get her. They took my wife away and
she never came back&mdash;they’ll never get her!” A few
soothing words to allay the storm she had unconsciously
raised, another expression of sympathy, and the
field worker drove away, pondering deeply the meaning
of what had been seen and heard.</p>

<p>We have come to the point where we no longer leave
babies or little children to die uncared for in our streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but who has yet thought of caring intelligently for the
vastly more pathetic child-man or child-woman, who
through matured sex powers, which they do not understand,
fill our land with its overflowing measure of misery
and crime? Such thoughts as these filled the mind
of the field worker on the ride home.</p>

<p>Arrived at B&mdash;&mdash;, her first care was to obtain an interview
with the doctor who had attended Guss’s wife
when she died. She found him ready to explain all he
could of the family which he had always known and
attended. “The mother,” he said, “was a kind-hearted,
simple-minded soul, who tended as best she could to the
needs of her family.” The epileptic girl, he explained,
had always been a great care, and the doctor himself,
aided by several prominent citizens, had taken the
trouble to complete all necessary arrangements for having
her admitted to the epileptic colony at Skillman.
The father, however, could never be made to give his
consent. The mother was still quite young when she
was carrying her eleventh child. Some accident happened
which threatened her with a miscarriage. The
doctor was summoned. He saw that it was a serious
case and sent for two other physicians in consultation.
It was decided that an immediate operation was necessary,
if the woman’s life was to be saved. They succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in persuading Guss to allow her to be removed
to the hospital. Their efforts, however, were unavailing;
she died under the operation.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of B&mdash;&mdash; lived the owner of the Cedarhill
farm worked by Guss Saunders. He proved to be
an intelligent man, with an admirably appointed home.
He was keenly alive to the needs of the family, about
which the field worker came to inquire. “The pity
about Guss,” he began, “is that he can never let drink
alone. Why, do you know, if I paid that man wages,
he’d use every cent for rum. I ceased giving him money
long ago, for if I had, the town would have had to look
after his children. I give him credit at the store, and
they supply him with what he needs.”</p>

<p class="tb">The foregoing glimpses of the defective branch of the
Kallikak family must suffice, though the field worker’s
memory and notebook contain many similar instances.</p>

<p class="tb">In turning to describe the other branch of the family,
two difficulties confront the writer.</p>

<p>First, the question of identification. The persons
already described are either gone and have left nothing
behind them by which they can be identified, or, if
living, will never recognize themselves in this book.</p>

<p>The opposite is true of the good family. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
them will recognize themselves, but the public must not
discover them. To insure this, the writer must refrain
from telling the very facts that would give the story its
most interesting touches.</p>

<p>The second difficulty is that a description of the activity
of a normal family of respectability and usefulness
is never as interesting as the bizarre experiences of
the abnormal.</p>

<p>Hence the reader will find in the following sketches
only such facts as will show the thoroughly normal and
regular family life of the intelligent citizens of a commonwealth.</p>

<p>In a certain village of New Jersey, lying picturesquely
on the crest of a hill, is a graveyard where Martin Kallikak
Sr. and several of his immediate descendants lie
peacefully at rest. He had in his lifetime a great passion
for the accumulation of land and left large farms
to most of his children. These farms lie in the vicinity
of the aforesaid village. Some of them are still in the
possession of his descendants, while others have passed
into strangers’ hands. On the hill above this village
is a stucco farmhouse in a fine state of preservation.
It belonged to Amos&mdash;lineal descendant of one of the
colonial governors of New Jersey and to Elizabeth,
daughter of Martin Kallikak Sr. The farm is, at present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in the possession of the widow of Elizabeth’s grandson,
the latter having been a minister in New York City.
In renting the farm, the family has always retained a
wing of the house, which, although remodeled, still
presents much the same appearance as in the days of
Amos and Elizabeth. There is the same fireplace, the
same high-backed chairs, the clock, desk, and china
cupboard. Every summer the family has come back to
the old place to enjoy the country air, the luscious
grapes and other fruit planted by their ancestor.</p>

<p>On another hill, less than two miles distant, lives a
granddaughter of the same Amos and Elizabeth. Her
father had been, in his day, one of the wealthiest and
most prominent citizens of the community. In an old
desk, part of his inheritance from his mother, was found
a number of valuable papers belonging to the Kallikak
family. One of these is the famous deed of the original
purchase made in 17&mdash; by Casper Kallikak, signed by
the governor of the colony. These papers the daughter
guards with great pride. She is a woman of ability
and manages her large farm with admirable skill. The
splendid old homestead, which has been remodeled and
fitted up with all modern conveniences, was built by
her mother’s ancestor. Although she is deeply interested
in all family matters, she has been too much engrossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in business affairs to have given this subject
much attention. A daughter of hers, however, who has
inherited the taste, has been able to make up for her
mother’s lack in this respect. The young woman is
now married, and her oldest son bears the united name
of his two ancestors, the colonial governor and Martin
Kallikak.</p>

<p>Miriam, the oldest daughter of Martin Sr., married
a man who was a carpenter and a farmer. Although of
good family, yet, for some unknown reason, he was not
personally acceptable to Martin or his wife. Miriam
died when only thirty-six years old, and her husband
married again. In his will, Martin makes no mention
of his grandchildren by this daughter. They have been
respectable farming people, but have never held the
same social position as the other members of the family.</p>

<p>Martin’s third daughter, Susan, married a man descended
from a family conspicuous in the colonial history
of New Jersey and which counts among its members
one of the founders of Princeton University, while
a collateral branch furnished a signer to the Declaration
of Independence. One of Susan’s sons is still living,
having attained the advanced age of ninety-eight.
He is a resident of the town that bears his family name
and has always been conspicuous as a loyal and upright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
citizen. To-day, the old man has quite lost his mental
power but retains his courteous manner and placid
gentlemanly countenance.</p>

<p>In a central region of northern New Jersey, remote
from any direct line of travel, lies a town named for
one of the families connected with the earliest settlement
of the colony. This family rose to distinction in
many of its branches, but honors itself chiefly for having
produced one of the most brilliant advocates of the
cause of Independence of which New Jersey can boast.
He was descended on his mother’s side from the first
president of Princeton University and took his degree
there before he was sixteen years of age. From this
family, Martin Kallikak’s youngest son, Joseph, chose
his wife. It is interesting to note that the descendants
of this pair have shown a marked tendency toward
professional careers. One daughter, however, married
a farmer, and most of her descendants have remained
fixed to the soil. Another daughter married a prominent
merchant, and this line, having been fixed in the
city, has produced men chiefly engaged in mercantile
pursuits; but the sons, of whom there were five, all
studied medicine, and although only one of these became
a practicing physician, their children have carried
on the family tradition in this line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>On the outskirts of another New Jersey town, in a
beautiful old homestead, inherited from his mother,
lives a grandson of Frederick Kallikak, oldest son of
Martin. He is a courteous, scholarly man of the old
school. His home is rendered particularly attractive
by the presence of his southern wife and two charming
daughters. In his possession are numerous articles
belonging to his great-grandfather. This gentleman
manifested such an intelligent interest in giving information
in regard to his family that it seemed a question
of honor to inform him as to the purpose of the investigation,
laying bare the facts set forth in this book.
He proved to be, perhaps, the one man best qualified
in the entire family for entering into an analysis of its
characteristics, and this he did freely, in so far as it
would serve the ends of the investigation.</p>

<p>Another descendant of Martin Kallikak Sr., a granddaughter
of his youngest child, Abbie, had been previously
informed regarding the same facts. This lady
is a person not only of refinement and culture but is the
author of two scholarly genealogical works. She has,
for years, been collecting material for a similar study
of the Kallikak family. This material she generously
submitted to the use of the field worker. In the end she
spent an entire day in the completion and revision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the normal chart presented in this book. No praise
can be too high for such disinterested self-forgetfulness
in the face of an urgent public need. We owe to these
two persons most of the information which has made
possible the study of the normal side of this family.</p>

<p>Of Martin Kallikak Sr., himself, the record of many
characteristic traits has been preserved. As stated
in another chapter, his father died when he was a lad of
fifteen. The father, in his will, after enumerating certain
personal bequests to his wife, recommends the
selling of the homestead farm, in order to provide for
the education of his children. There is a quaint document
still in existence, in which Martin Kallikak, having
attained his majority, agrees to pay £250 to each
of his three “spinster” sisters, still minors, in return for
a quitclaim deed of the homestead farm. This was
a considerable burden for a young man to assume, but
it seems to have given him the impetus which later
made him a rich and prosperous farmer.</p>

<p>He had joined the Revolutionary Army in April,
1776. Two years later he was wounded in a way to
disable him for further service, and he then returned
to the home farm. During the summer of enforced
idleness he wooed and won the heart of a young woman
of good Quaker family. Her shrewd old father, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
refused to give his consent. To his objections,
based on the ground that Martin did not own enough
of this world’s goods, the young man is recorded as
saying, “Never mind. I will own more land than ever
thou did, before I die,” which promise he made true.
That the paternal objection was overruled is proven by
the registry of marriages, which gives the date of Martin’s
union with the Quakeress as January, 1779.</p>

<p>The old Bible of Casper Kallikak, one of the family
heirlooms, is in the possession of a Reverend Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
who is descended from Casper through the line of one
of his daughters. This Bible was bought in 1704 and
is still in an excellent state of preservation, for, although
time-stained, the pages are intact and there still may
be seen in legible handwriting the family record penned
so long ago. On a flyleaf, is a quaint verse in which
old Casper bequeaths the volume to his eldest son,
bidding him, “So oft as in it he doth looke” remember
how his father had “aye been guided by ye precepts in
this booke,” and enjoining him to walk in the same safe
way.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT IS TO BE DONE?</span></h2>

<p>No one interested in the progress of civilization can
contemplate the facts presented in the previous chapters
without having the question arise, Why isn’t something
done about this? It will be more to the point if
we put the question, Why do <em>we</em> not <em>do</em> something
about it? We are thus face to face with the problem
in a practical way and we ask ourselves the next question,
What <em>can</em> we do? For the low-grade idiot, the
loathsome unfortunate that may be seen in our institutions,
some have proposed the lethal chamber. But
humanity is steadily tending away from the possibility
of that method, and there is no probability that it will
ever be practiced.</p>

<p>But in view of such conditions as are shown in the
defective side of the Kallikak family, we begin to realize
that the idiot is not our greatest problem. He is indeed
loathsome; he is somewhat difficult to take care of;
nevertheless, he lives his life and is done. He does not
continue the race with a line of children like himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Because of his very low-grade condition, he never becomes
a parent.</p>

<p>It is the moron type that makes for us our great
problem. And when we face the question, “What is
to be done with them&mdash;with such people as make up a
large proportion of the bad side of the Kallikak family?”
we realize that we have a huge problem.</p>

<p>The career of Martin Kallikak Sr. is a powerful sermon
against sowing wild oats. Martin Kallikak did
what unfortunately many a young man like him has
done before and since, and which, still more unfortunately,
society has too often winked at, as being merely
a side step in accordance with a natural instinct, bearing
no serious results. It is quite possible that Martin
Kallikak himself never gave any serious thought to his
act, or if he did, it may have been merely to realize that
in his youth he had been indiscreet and had done that
for which he was sorry. And being sorry he may have
thought it was atoned for, as he never suffered from it
any serious consequences.</p>

<p>Even the people of his generation, however much
they may have known about the circumstances, could
not have begun to realize the evil that had been done.
Undoubtedly, it was only looked upon as a sin because
it was a violation of the moral law. The real sin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
peopling the world with a race of defective degenerates
who would probably commit his sin a thousand times
over, was doubtless not perceived or realized. It is
only after the lapse of six generations that we are able
to look back, count up and see the havoc that was
wrought by that one thoughtless act.</p>

<p>Now that the facts are known, let the lesson be
learned; let the sermons be preached; let it be impressed
upon our young men of good family that they
dare not step aside for even a moment. Let all possible
use be made of these facts, and something will be accomplished.</p>

<p>But even so the real problem will not be solved. Had
Martin Kallikak remained in the paths of virtue, there
still remained the nameless feeble-minded girl, and there
were other people, other young men, perhaps not of as
good a family as Martin, perhaps feeble-minded like
herself, capable of the same act and without Martin’s
respectability, so that the race would have come down
even worse if possible than it was, because of having a
worse father.</p>

<p>Others will look at the chart and say, “The difficulty
began with the nameless feeble-minded girl; had
she been taken care of, all of this trouble would have
been avoided.” This is largely true. Although feeble-mindedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
came into this family from other sources
in two generations at least, yet nevertheless these
sources were other feeble-minded persons. When we
conclude that had the nameless girl been segregated in
an institution, this defective family would not have
existed, we of course do not mean that one single act of
precaution, in that case, would have solved the problem,
but we mean that all such cases, male and female,
must be taken care of, before their propagation will
cease. The instant we grasp this thought, we realize
that we are facing a problem that presents two great
difficulties; in the first place the difficulty of knowing
who are the feeble-minded people; and, secondly,
the difficulty of taking care of them when they are
known.</p>

<p>A large proportion of those who are considered feeble-minded
in this study are persons who would not be
recognized as such by the untrained observer. They
are not the imbeciles nor idiots who plainly show in
their countenances the extent of their mental defect.
They are people whom the community has tolerated and
helped to support, at the same time that it has deplored
their vices and their inefficiency. They are people who
have won the pity rather than the blame of their neighbors,
but no one has seemed to suspect the real cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of their delinquencies, which careful psychological tests
have now determined to be feeble-mindedness.</p>

<p>The second difficulty is that of caring for this large
army of people. At the lowest estimates of the number
needing care, we in the United States are at present
caring for approximately one tenth of the estimated
number of our mental defectives. Yet many of our
States think that they are now being over-taxed for the
care of these people, so that it is with great difficulty
that legislatures can be induced to appropriate money
enough to care for those already in institutions. It
is impossible to entertain the thought of caring for ten
times as many. Some other method must be devised
for dealing with the difficulty.</p>

<p>Before considering any other method, the writer
would insist that segregation and colonization is not
by any means as hopeless a plan as it may seem to those
who look only at the immediate increase in the tax rate.
If such colonies were provided in sufficient number to
take care of all the distinctly feeble-minded cases in
the community, they would very largely take the place
of our present almshouses and prisons, and they would
greatly decrease the number in our insane hospitals.
Such colonies would save an annual loss in property
and life, due to the action of these irresponsible people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
sufficient to nearly, or quite, offset the expense of the
new plant. Besides, if these feeble-minded children
were early selected and carefully trained, they would
become more or less self-supporting in their institutions,
so that the expense of their maintenance would be
greatly reduced.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the number would be reduced, in a
single generation, from 300,000 (the estimated number
in the United States) to 100,000, at least,&mdash;and probably
even lower. (We have found the hereditary factor
in 65 per cent of cases; while others place it as high
as 80 per cent.)</p>

<p>This is not the place for arguing the question or producing
the statistics to substantiate these statements.
Suffice it to say that every institution in the land has
a certain proportion of inmates who not only earn their
own living, but some who could go out into the world
and support themselves, were it not for the terrible
danger of procreation,&mdash;resulting in our having not
one person merely, but several to be cared for at the
expense of the State. These statements should be
carefully considered and investigated before any one
takes the stand that segregation in colonies and homes
is impossible and unwise for the State.</p>

<p>The other method proposed of solving the problem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is to take away from these people the power of procreation.
The earlier method proposed was unsexing, asexualization,
as it is sometimes called, or the removing,
from the male and female, the necessary organs for
procreation. The operation in the female is that of
ovariectomy and in the male of castration.</p>

<p>There are two great practical difficulties in the way
of carrying out this method on any large scale. The
first is the strong opposition to this practice on the part
of the public generally. It is regarded as mutilation
of the human body and as such is opposed vigorously
by many people. And while there is no rational basis
for this, nevertheless we have, as practical reformers,
to recognize the fact that the average man acts not
upon reason, but upon sentiment and feeling; and as
long as human sentiment and feeling are opposed to this
practice, no amount of reasoning will avail. It may
be shown over and over again that many a woman has
had the operation of ovariectomy performed in order
to improve her physical condition, and that it is just as
important to improve the moral condition as the physical.
Nevertheless, the argument does not convince,
and there remains the opposition as stated.</p>

<p>In recent years surgeons have discovered another
method which has many advantages. This is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sometimes incorrectly referred to as asexualization.
It is more properly spoken of as sterilization, the distinction
being that it does not have any effect on the
sex qualities of the man or woman, but does artificially
take away the power of procreation by rendering the
person sterile. The operation itself is almost as simple
in males as having a tooth pulled. In females it is not
much more serious. The results are generally permanent
and sure. Objection is urged that we do not know
the consequences of this action upon the physical, mental,
and moral nature of the individual. The claim is
made that it is good in all of these. But it must be
confessed that we are as yet ignorant of actual facts.
It has been tried in many cases; no bad results have
been reported, while many good results have been
claimed.</p>

<p>A more serious objection to this last method comes
from a consideration of the social consequences. What
will be the effect upon the community in the spread of
debauchery and disease through having within it a
group of people who are thus free to gratify their instincts
without fear of consequences in the form of
children? The indications are that here also the evil
consequences are more imaginary than real, since the
feeble-minded seldom exercise restraint in any case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably the most serious difficulty to be overcome
before the practice of sterilization in any form could
come into general use would be the determining of
what persons were proper subjects to be operated upon.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This difficulty arises from the fact that we are still
ignorant of the exact laws of inheritance. Just how
mental characteristics are transmitted from parent to
child is not yet definitely known. It therefore becomes
a serious matter to decide beforehand that such and
such a person who has mental defect would certainly
transmit the same defect to his offspring and that
consequently he ought not to be allowed to have offspring.</p>

<h3>THE MENDELIAN LAW</h3>

<p>In 1866 an Austrian monk by the name of Gregor
Mendel discovered and published a law of inheritance
in certain plants, which, after lying practically unknown
for nearly forty years, was rediscovered in 1900 and
since then has been tested with regard to a great many
plants and animals.</p>

<p>Mendel found that there were certain peculiarities
in plants which he termed “unit characters” that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
transmitted from parent to offspring in a definite way.
His classical work was on the propagation of the ordinary
garden pea, in which case he found that a quality
like tallness, as contrasted with dwarfness, was transmitted
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>If tall and dwarf peas were crossed, he found in the
first generation nothing but tall peas. But if these
peas were allowed to grow and fertilize themselves, in
the next generation he got tall and dwarf peas in the
ratio of three to one. The dwarf peas in this case bred
true, <i>i.e.</i> when they were planted by themselves and
self-fertilized there was never anything but dwarf peas,
no matter how many generations were tested. On the
other hand, the tall peas were divisible by experiment
into two groups; first, those that always bred true,
viz. always tall peas; and secondly, another group that
bred tall and dwarf in the same ratio of three to one;
and from these the same cycle was repeated. Mendel
called the character, which did <em>not</em> appear in the first
generation (dwarfness), “recessive”; the other (tallness)
he called “dominant.” The recessive factor is
now generally considered to be due to the absence of
something which, if present, would give the dominant
factor. According to this view, dwarfness is simply
the absence of tallness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>This law has been found to hold true for many unit
characters in many plants and animals. Since study
in human heredity has been taken up, it has been a
natural question, Does this same law apply to human
beings? It has been found that it does apply in the
case of many qualities, like color of hair, albinism,
brachydactylism, and other peculiarities. Investigation
has of late been extended to mental conditions.
Rosanoff has shown pretty clearly that the law applies
in the case of insanity, while Davenport and Weeks
have shown evidence that it applies in cases of epilepsy.</p>

<p>Our own studies lead us to believe that it also applies
in the case of feeble-mindedness, but this will be taken
up in a later work to which we have already referred.
We do not know that feeble-mindedness is a “unit
character.” Indeed, there are many reasons for thinking
that it cannot be. But assuming for the sake of
simplifying our illustration that it is a “unit character,”
then we have something like the following conditions.</p>

<p>If two feeble-minded people marry, then we have the
same unit character in both, and all of the offspring will
be feeble-minded; and if these offspring select feeble-minded
mates, then the same thing will continue. But
what will happen if a feeble-minded person takes a
normal mate? If feeble-mindedness is recessive (due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to the absence of something that would make for normality),
we would expect in the first generation from
such a union all normal children, and if these children
marry persons like themselves, <i>i.e.</i> the offspring of
one normal and one defective parent, then the offspring
would be normal and defective in the ratio of three to
one. Of the normal children, one third would breed
true and we would have a normal line of descent.</p>

<p>Without following the illustration further, we see
already that it is questionable whether we ought to say
that the original feeble-minded individual should have
been sterilized because he was feeble-minded. We see
that in the first generation all of his children were normal
and in the next generation one fourth of them were
normal and bred true. We should not forget, however,
that one fourth of his grandchildren would be
feeble-minded and that two other fourths had the power
of begetting feeble-minded children. We must not
forget, either, that these are averages, and that for the
full carrying out of these figures there must be a large
enough number of offspring to give the law of averages
room to have full play. In other words, any marriage
which, according to the Mendelian principle, would
give normals and defectives in the ratio of three to one
might result in only one child. That child might happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to be one of the feeble-minded ones, and so there is
propagated nothing but the feeble-minded type. It is
equally true that it might be the normal child, with a
consequent normal line of descendants; or still again,
it might be one of the intermediate ones that are capable
of reproducing again the ratio of three normal to
one defective, so that the chance is only one in four of
such offspring starting a normal line.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the facts as we have them in the
Kallikak family. The only offspring from Martin
Kallikak Sr. and the nameless feeble-minded girl was
a son who proved to be feeble-minded. He married a
normal woman and had five feeble-minded children
and two normal ones. This is in accordance with
Mendelian expectation; that is to say, there should
have been part normal and part defective, half and
half, if there had been children enough to give the law
of averages a chance to assert itself. The question,
then, comes right there. Should Martin Jr. have been
sterilized? We would thus have saved five feeble-minded
individuals and their horrible progeny, but we
would also have deprived society of two normal individuals;
and, as the results show, these two normals
married normal people and became the first of a series
of generations of normal people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking this family as a whole, we have the following
figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>There were 41 matings where both parents were feeble-minded.
They had 222 feeble-minded children, with
two others that were considered normal. These two
are apparent exceptions to the law that two feeble-minded
parents do not have anything but feeble-minded
children. We may account for these two exceptions
in one of several ways. Either there is a mistake in
calling them normal, or a mistake in calling the parents
feeble-minded; or else there was illegitimacy somewhere
and these two children did not have the same father as
the others of the family. Or we may turn to the Mendelian
law and we discover that according to that law
there might be in rare instances such a combination of
circumstances that a normal child might be born from
two parents that function as feeble-minded. For practical
purposes it is, of course, pretty clear that it is
safe to assume that two feeble-minded parents will
never have anything but feeble-minded children.</p>

<p>Again, we find that there were eight cases where the
father was feeble-minded and the mother normal, and
there were ten normal children and ten defective.</p>

<p>There were twelve cases where the father was normal
and the mother feeble-minded, with seven feeble-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
children and ten normal. Both of these are in accordance
with Mendelian expectations.</p>

<p>We further find that in the cases where one parent
was feeble-minded and the other undetermined, the
children were nearly all feeble-minded, from which we
might infer that the probabilities are great that the
unknown parent was also feeble-minded.</p>

<p>We shall not go further into this matter in the present
paper, but leave the detailed study of this family from
the Mendelian standpoint for further consideration,
when we take up the large amount of data which we
have on three hundred other families. Enough is here
given to show the possibility that the Mendelian law
applies to human heredity. If it does, then the necessity
follows of our understanding the exact mental condition
of the ancestors of any person upon whom we
may propose to practice sterilization.</p>

<p>From all of this the one caution follows. At best,
sterilization is not likely to be a final solution of this
problem. We may, and indeed I believe must, use it
as a help, as something that will contribute toward the
solution, until we can get segregation thoroughly established.
But in using it, we must realize that the
first necessity is the careful study of the whole subject,
to the end that we may know more both about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
laws of inheritance and the ultimate effect of the
operation.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION AND RÉSUMÉ</h3>

<p>The Kallikak family presents a natural experiment
in heredity. A young man of good family becomes
through two different women the ancestor of two lines
of descendants,&mdash;the one characterized by thoroughly
good, respectable, normal citizenship, with almost
no exceptions; the other being equally characterized
by mental defect in every generation. This defect was
transmitted through the father in the first generation.
In later generations, more defect was brought in from
other families through marriage. In the last generation
it was transmitted through the mother, so that we
have here all combinations of transmission, which
again proves the truly hereditary character of the defect.</p>

<p>We find on the good side of the family prominent
people in all walks of life and nearly all of the 496
descendants owners of land or proprietors. On the
bad side we find paupers, criminals, prostitutes, drunkards,
and examples of all forms of social pest with which
modern society is burdened.</p>

<p>From this we conclude that feeble-mindedness is
largely responsible for these social sores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Feeble-mindedness is hereditary and transmitted as
surely as any other character. We cannot successfully
cope with these conditions until we recognize feeble-mindedness
and its hereditary nature, recognize it early,
and take care of it.</p>

<p>In considering the question of care, segregation
through colonization seems in the present state of our
knowledge to be the ideal and perfectly satisfactory
method. Sterilization may be accepted as a makeshift,
as a help to solve this problem because the conditions
have become so intolerable. But this must at present
be regarded only as a makeshift and temporary, for
before it can be extensively practiced, a great deal
must be learned about the effects of the operation and
about the laws of human inheritance.</p>

<p class="book">Introduction to General Science</p>

<p class="right"><i>Cloth <span class="spacer">12mo</span> 302 pages $.75</i></p>

<p>The increasing demand for a thorough, comprehensible, and practical
textbook on the subject is met by Rowell’s “Introduction to General
Science,” the distinctive features of which are:</p>

<p>1. The book gives a broad, adequate view of the general field of
science. The elements of physics and chemistry receive particular emphasis,
but biology, physiography, and several phases of applied science
are duly considered.</p>

<p>2. Despite the necessity for treating various sciences, the book is remarkable
for its continuity of thought. The interrelation of scientific
facts is constantly and clearly pointed out.</p>

<p>3. The treatment is clear-cut, brisk, and thorough, the material well
chosen and up to date, while the general workmanship of the book
renders it attractive and serviceable.</p>

<p>4. There are over 90 laboratory exercises in the book, a number of
them entirely new, and all of them illustrative of the text.</p>

<p>5. Reference reading is encouraged, and lists of carefully selected
standard reference books are suggested. Those teachers, however, who
do not care to take up detailed work of this sort may give a satisfactory
course by using in connection with the book United States Government
bulletins alone, to which definite reference is made in the lists of reference
readings throughout the book.</p>

<p class="center">TEACHERS</p>

<p class="noindent">call the book “thorough,” “practical,” “comprehensive,” “clear,” “satisfactory,”
“a great aid to the science teacher.”</p>

<p>Mr. N. P. Lawson of Taunton, Washington, writes:</p>

<p>“I have examined Rowell’s ‘Introduction to General Science’ quite
carefully. It wears. The more I use it the better I like it. There is
room left for the teacher. He doesn’t have to crowd himself in. This
book can hardly fail to inoculate any one with the bulletin habit, in
which I am a firm believer. In its encouragement of wide reading and
first-hand acquaintance with books through the excellent references
given, this compact little volume is an education in itself. If I were
with your company I should wish to push this book. I believe in it.”</p>

<p class="book">The Laws of Heredity</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By G. ARCHDALL REID, M.B., F.R.S.E.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By HERBERT HALL TURNER,</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="spacer"><i>Cloth, 8vo, xi + 548 pages, $5.50</i></span> <i>by mail, $5.04</i></p>

<p>The question of heredity is one of vital concern to every living
being, and any light thrown on the subject by scientific investigations
and experiments is of momentous interest to the human
race. It is therefore of the utmost importance that every one
should have some knowledge of the theories advanced by those
who believe in the immutability of the laws of heredity, and also
how far these have been proven modifiable by environment and
education.</p>

<p>The present volume is a discussion of the entire subject,
covering a much wider area than the author’s “The Principles of
Heredity,” and presenting the facts and arguments in a scholarly
and yet clear and non-technical manner; the aim being to make
it comprehensible to the general reader, as well as to the scientific
investigator.</p>

<p class="book">The First Principles of Heredity</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By S. HERBERT</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="spacer"><i>Cloth, 8vo, illustrated, $1.75</i></span> <i>by mail, $1.87</i></p>

<p>This book is the only one of its scope in the English
language. It gives a popularly written yet scientific account
of all that the average educated reader may desire
to know about “Heredity and Kindred Subjects,” without
assuming any knowledge of the subject on the reader’s
part.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25</i></p>

<p>“With keen philosophic insight Professor Patten, in this
book, probes to the roots of biology and plants there the
foundations of economics and other social sciences. It is a
bold deduction, wrought out with perfect logic, and shows
one common principle active in every advance from the
lowest unicellular organism to the highest social institution.”&mdash;<cite>Annals

in a clear and sometimes rather startling manner.”&mdash;<cite>Ohio

<p class="book">Conduct and its Disorders
Biologically Considered</p>

<p class="center">By CHARLES ARTHUR MERCIER, M.D., F.R.C.P., F.R.C.S.,<br />
Physician for Mental Diseases to Charing Cross Hospital; Author of
“A Textbook of Insanity,” “Criminal Responsibility,” etc.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="spacer"><i>Cloth, 8vo, xxiii + 377 pages, index, $3.23</i></span> <i>by mail, $3.42</i></p>

<p>Although Dr. Mercier’s work on <cite>Conduct and its Disorders</cite> will be of
special service to students of mental disease, the subject is one of such wide
interest that other readers, less interested perhaps in its scientific aspects, will
find the work full of suggestive information. The author points out that
although conduct is what we are all engaged in, from birth to death, and
though many departments of conduct are described in many books, there is
not in existence, curiously enough, any comprehensive study of conduct as a
whole&mdash;any general view of the field of human activity. It is this gap that
Dr. Mercier has set himself to fill by the present work. The principle on
which his exhaustive investigation has been made is the biological principle.
He has estimated the various modes and phases of human activity in the
light of their value in securing the survival of man in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="spacer"><i>New edition revised and enlarged. Cloth, 12mo, illustrated,
$1.25</i></span> <i>by mail, $1.38</i></p>

<p>“By far the best popular account of Mendelism yet published … a
model of popular scientific writing, recalling Huxley at his best.… Another
master of popular scientific writing has well characterized Punnett’s book as
‘an unsurpassed exposition by an expert investigator.’”&mdash;<cite>The Dial.</cite></p>

<p>“A substantial contribution from one of the most active laboratories of genetics,
presented in a readable and attractive form.”&mdash;<cite>The Nation.</cite></p>

<p>“As an exposition of Mendelism it is comprehensive, authoritative and
clear, and alone in its field.”&mdash;<cite>Chicago Evening Post.</cite></p>

<p>“The book sets forth the theory of Mendelism with exceptional clearness
making it especially valuable for the practical gardener or breeder and the
general reader, while it may be used as a textbook in biological courses.”&mdash;<cite>Springfield
Republican.</cite></p>

<p class="book">Confessio Medici</p>

<p class="right"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25</i></p>

<p>“A number of exquisite and philosophical essays on the medical art
in its broadest aspects, apparently pervaded by a realization of what the
science of medicine might be and how far it falls short of its ideals.…
These essays are delightful to read. They are wise and shrewd,
instinct with a knowledge of human nature, with benevolence and with
a humility that recognizes its own shortcomings rather than its own
attainments.”&mdash;<cite>Argonaut.</cite></p>

<p>“The book abounds in amiable prejudices stated with candour and
argued with ingenuity. It is written in many moods, sentimental,
practical, reflective, and pugnacious, and in a style that is brisk, sententious,
always readable.”&mdash;<cite>The Bookman.</cite></p>

<p>“After reading many half-baked books on psychotherapy and New
Thought, it is refreshing to come upon ‘The Conquest of Nerves,’ by
a man who knows his subject and speaks with authority backed by common
sense, thinking clearly through a hazy theme and shedding truth
with entertaining pungency.”&mdash;<cite>Boston Traveler.</cite></p>

<p>“The book is simple, earnest, and practical.”&mdash;<cite>Christian Register.</cite></p>

<p>“That nerves can be conquered and how they may be is the subject
of the doctor’s most unusual and interesting volume, which should find
a royal welcome from the many sufferers for whom it was written.”&mdash;<cite>Hartford

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
